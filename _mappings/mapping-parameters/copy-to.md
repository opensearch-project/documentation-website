# Copy to

The `copy_to` parameter allows you to copy the values of multiple fields into a group field, which can then be queried as a single field. This is useful when you frequently search across multiple fields and want to simplify your queries.

Note the following important considerations:

- During copying, the raw field value (not the tokens produced during analysis) is copied.

- The original `_source` field is not modified to reflect the copied values.

- The same value can be copied to multiple fields using `"copy_to": ["field_1", "field_2"]` syntax.

- You cannot copy recursively through intermediary fields. For example, if `field_1` is copied to `field_2` and `field_2` is copied to `field_3`, indexing into `field_1` does not result in values appearing in `field_3`. Instead, use `copy_to` directly from the originating field to multiple target fields.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate using the `copy_to` parameter.

### Basic copy_to usage

Create an index that copies first and last names into a `full_name` field:

```json
PUT /user_profiles
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "first_name": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "full_name"
      },
      "last_name": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "full_name"
      },
      "full_name": {
        "type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Index a document with separate name fields:

```json
PUT /user_profiles/_doc/1
{
  "first_name": "Jane",
  "last_name": "Doe"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The `first_name` and `last_name` fields can still be queried individually, but the `full_name` field allows you to search for both names together. To search using the combined field, send the following request. The `and` operator requires both terms to match:

```json
GET /user_profiles/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "full_name": {
        "query": "Jane Doe",
        "operator": "and"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains the matching document:

```json
{
  "took": 7,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 1,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 0.26152915,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "user_profiles",
        "_id": "1",
        "_score": 0.26152915,
        "_source": {
          "first_name": "Jane",
          "last_name": "Doe"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Copying to multiple target fields

To copy the field contents to multiple target fields, create an index that copies the `title` field into both the `searchable_content` and `display_text` fields. The `body` field is copied only to `searchable_content`:

```json
PUT /content_library
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": ["searchable_content", "display_text"]
      },
      "body": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "searchable_content"
      },
      "searchable_content": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "display_text": {
        "type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Index a document containing the `title` and `body` fields:

```json
PUT /content_library/_doc/1
{
  "title": "OpenSearch Documentation Guide",
  "body": "This comprehensive guide covers mapping parameters and their usage in OpenSearch."
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

You can search both title and body content using the `searchable_content` field:

```json
GET /content_library/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "searchable_content": "OpenSearch mapping parameters"
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains the matching document. The document's original `_source` field still contains only the `title` and `body` fields:

```json
{
  "took": 21,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 1,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 0.44133043,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "content_library",
        "_id": "1",
        "_score": 0.44133043,
        "_source": {
          "title": "OpenSearch Documentation Guide",
          "body": "This comprehensive guide covers mapping parameters and their usage in OpenSearch."
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
