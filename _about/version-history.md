:--- | :--- | :--- 
[3.3.2](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/blob/main/release-notes/opensearch-release-notes-3.3.2.md) | Includes maintenance changes and bug fixes for the OpenSearch core engine and ML Commons, Neural Search, Skills, k-NN and Security plugins. For a full list of release highlights, see the [Release Notes](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/blob/main/release-notes/opensearch-release-notes-3.3.2.md). | 30 October 2025
[3.3.1](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/blob/main/release-notes/opensearch-release-notes-3.3.1.md) | Fixes backward compatibility handling of date fields while maintaining performance optimizations. The `skip_list` parameter is now automatically set to `true` for new `@timestamp` fields created since 3.3.0, while preserving `skip_list=false` for existing indexes with `@timestamp` or index sort date fields. This approach ensures date histogram aggregation performance benefits for new indexes while maintaining compatibility with existing workloads.
