# Agents and Ingestion Tools

Historically, there have been multiple popular agents and ingestion tools that work with Elasticsearch. Some of which are Beats, Logstash, Fluentd, FluentBit, and Open Telemetry. OpenSearch aims to continue to support a broad set of agents and ingestion tools, but not all have been tested or have explicitly added OpenSearch compatibility. To make getting started with OpenSearch easier, a [version value](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/693) is being added to the OpenSearch YML. This will let you set OpenSearch 1.x clusters to report version 7.10.2. By reporting 7.10.2, the cluster will be able to connect with tools that do version checking for that version number. This is intended to be an intermediate solution while OpenSearch support is added to more tools.


## Compatibility Matrices

So far we have built compatibility matrices for OpenSearch, Elasticsearch OSS 7.x, Open Distro for Elasticsearch (ODFE) 1.x, Logstash OSS 7.x, and Beats OSS 7.x. **This page is a living document. If there are other versions or software you would like to add to the page please [submit a PR](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/edit/main/docs/agents-and-ingestion-tools/index.md) and add yourself to the "Credits and Thanks you" section at the bottom of the page. We greatly appreciate the help!** 

Note that if a cell in any of the matrices is *italicized* that means the value is theoretically what it should be based on other documentation or release notes, but it is still pending testing. Also note that for Logstash we have included a column for version 7.13.x with the [proposed OpenSearch output plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/820).
