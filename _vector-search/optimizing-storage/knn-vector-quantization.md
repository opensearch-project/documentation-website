# Vector quantization

By default, OpenSearch supports the indexing and querying of vectors of type `float`, where each dimension of the vector occupies 4 bytes of memory. For use cases that require ingestion on a large scale, keeping `float` vectors can be expensive because OpenSearch needs to construct, load, save, and search graphs (for the native `faiss` and `nmslib` [deprecated] engines). To reduce the memory footprint, you can use vector quantization.

OpenSearch supports many varieties of quantization. In general, the level of quantization will provide a trade-off between the accuracy of the nearest neighbor search and the size of the memory footprint consumed by the vector search. 

## Quantize vectors outside of OpenSearch

Quantize vectors outside of OpenSearch before ingesting them into an OpenSearch index.

## Quantize vectors within OpenSearch

Use OpenSearch built-in quantization to quantize vectors.
