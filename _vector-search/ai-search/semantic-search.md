# Semantic search

Semantic search considers the context and intent of a query. In OpenSearch, semantic search is facilitated by text embedding models. Semantic search creates a dense vector (a list of floats) and ingests data into a vector index. 

**PREREQUISITE**<br>
Before using semantic search, you must set up a text embedding model. For more information, see [Choosing a model]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/integrating-ml-models/#choosing-a-model).
{: .note}

## Configuring semantic search

There are two ways to configure semantic search:

- [**Automated workflow**](#automated-workflow) (Recommended for quick setup): Automatically create an ingest pipeline and index with minimal configuration.
- [**Manual setup**](#manual-setup) (Recommended for custom configurations): Manually configure each component for greater flexibility and control.

## Automated workflow

OpenSearch provides a [workflow template]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/automating-configurations/workflow-templates/#semantic-search) that automatically creates both an ingest pipeline and an index. You must provide the model ID for the configured model when creating a workflow. Review the semantic search workflow template [defaults](https://github.com/opensearch-project/flow-framework/blob/main/src/main/resources/defaults/semantic-search-defaults.json) to determine whether you need to update any of the parameters. For example, if the model dimensionality is different from the default (`1024`), specify the dimensionality of your model in the `output_dimension` parameter. To create the default semantic search workflow, send the following request:

```json
POST /_plugins/_flow_framework/workflow?use_case=semantic_search&provision=true
{
  "create_ingest_pipeline.model_id": "mBGzipQB2gmRjlv_dOoB"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

OpenSearch responds with a workflow ID for the created workflow:

```json
{
  "workflow_id" : "U_nMXJUBq_4FYQzMOS4B"
}
```

To check the workflow status, send the following request:

```json
GET /_plugins/_flow_framework/workflow/U_nMXJUBq_4FYQzMOS4B/_status
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Once the workflow completes, the `state` changes to `COMPLETED`. The workflow creates the following components:

- An ingest pipeline named `nlp-ingest-pipeline`
- An index named `my-nlp-index` 

You can now continue with [steps 3 and 4](#step-3-ingest-documents-into-the-index) to ingest documents into the index and search the index.

## Manual setup

To manually configure semantic search, follow these steps:

1. [Create an ingest pipeline](#step-1-create-an-ingest-pipeline).
1. [Create an index for ingestion](#step-2-create-an-index-for-ingestion).
1. [Ingest documents into the index](#step-3-ingest-documents-into-the-index).
1. [Search the index](#step-4-search-the-index).

### Step 1: Create an ingest pipeline

To generate vector embeddings, you need to create an [ingest pipeline]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/ingest-apis/index/) that contains a [`text_embedding` processor]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/ingest-apis/processors/text-embedding/), which will convert the text in a document field to vector embeddings. The processor's `field_map` determines the input fields from which to generate vector embeddings and the output fields in which to store the embeddings.

The following example request creates an ingest pipeline where the text from `passage_text` will be converted into text embeddings and the embeddings will be stored in `passage_embedding`:

```json
PUT /_ingest/pipeline/nlp-ingest-pipeline
{
  "description": "A text embedding pipeline",
  "processors": [
    {
      "text_embedding": {
        "model_id": "bQ1J8ooBpBj3wT4HVUsb",
        "field_map": {
          "passage_text": "passage_embedding"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

To split long text into passages, use the `text_chunking` ingest processor before the `text_embedding` processor. For more information, see [Text chunking]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/text-chunking/).

### Step 2: Create an index for ingestion

In order to use the text embedding processor defined in your pipeline, create a vector index, adding the pipeline created in the previous step as the default pipeline. Ensure that the fields defined in the `field_map` are mapped as correct types. Continuing with the example, the `passage_embedding` field must be mapped as a k-NN vector with a dimension that matches the model dimension. Similarly, the `passage_text` field should be mapped as `text`.

The following example request creates a vector index that is set up with a default ingest pipeline:

```json
PUT /my-nlp-index
{
  "settings": {
    "index.knn": true,
    "default_pipeline": "nlp-ingest-pipeline"
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "id": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "passage_embedding": {
        "type": "knn_vector",
        "dimension": 768,
        "method": {
          "engine": "lucene",
          "space_type": "l2",
          "name": "hnsw",
          "parameters": {}
        }
      },
      "passage_text": {
        "type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

For more information about creating a vector index and its supported methods, see [Creating a vector index]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/knn/knn-index/).

### Step 3: Ingest documents into the index

To ingest documents into the index created in the previous step, send the following requests:

```json
PUT /my-nlp-index/_doc/1
{
  "passage_text": "Hello world",
  "id": "s1"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

```json
PUT /my-nlp-index/_doc/2
{
  "passage_text": "Hi planet",
  "id": "s2"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Before the document is ingested into the index, the ingest pipeline runs the `text_embedding` processor on the document, generating text embeddings for the `passage_text` field. The indexed document includes the `passage_text` field, which contains the original text, and the `passage_embedding` field, which contains the vector embeddings. 

### Step 4: Search the index

To perform a vector search on your index, use the `neural` query clause either in the [Search for a Model API]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/vector-search/api/knn/#search-for-a-model) or [Query DSL]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/query-dsl/index/) queries. You can refine the results by using a [vector search filter]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/knn/filter-search-knn/).

The following example request uses a Boolean query to combine a filter clause and two query clauses---a neural query and a `match` query. The `script_score` query assigns custom weights to the query clauses:

```json
GET /my-nlp-index/_search
{
  "_source": {
    "excludes": [
      "passage_embedding"
    ]
  },
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "filter": {
         "wildcard":  { "id": "*1" }
      },
      "should": [
        {
          "script_score": {
            "query": {
              "neural": {
                "passage_embedding": {
                  "query_text": "Hi world",
                  "model_id": "bQ1J8ooBpBj3wT4HVUsb",
                  "k": 100
                }
              }
            },
            "script": {
              "source": "_score * 1.5"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "script_score": {
            "query": {
              "match": {
                "passage_text": "Hi world"
              }
            },
            "script": {
              "source": "_score * 1.7"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains the matching document:

```json
{
  "took" : 36,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 1,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.2251667,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "my-nlp-index",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 1.2251667,
        "_source" : {
          "passage_text" : "Hello world",
          "id" : "s1"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Setting a default model on an index or field

A [`neural`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/query-dsl/specialized/neural/) query requires a model ID for generating vector embeddings. To eliminate passing the model ID with each neural query request, you can set a default model on a vector index or a field. 

First, create a [search pipeline]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-pipelines/index/) with a [`neural_query_enricher`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-pipelines/neural-query-enricher/) request processor. To set a default model for an index, provide the model ID in the `default_model_id` parameter. To set a default model for a specific field, provide the field name and the corresponding model ID in the `neural_field_default_id` map. If you provide both `default_model_id` and `neural_field_default_id`, `neural_field_default_id` takes precedence:

```json
PUT /_search/pipeline/default_model_pipeline 
{
  "request_processors": [
    {
      "neural_query_enricher" : {
        "default_model_id": "bQ1J8ooBpBj3wT4HVUsb",
        "neural_field_default_id": {
           "my_field_1": "uZj0qYoBMtvQlfhaYeud",
           "my_field_2": "upj0qYoBMtvQlfhaZOuM"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Then set the default model for your index:

```json
PUT /my-nlp-index/_settings
{
  "index.search.default_pipeline" : "default_model_pipeline"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

You can now omit the model ID when searching:

```json
GET /my-nlp-index/_search
{
  "_source": {
    "excludes": [
      "passage_embedding"
    ]
  },
  "query": {
    "neural": {
      "passage_embedding": {
        "query_text": "Hi world",
        "k": 100
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains both documents:

```json
{
  "took" : 41,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 2,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.22762,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "my-nlp-index",
        "_id" : "2",
        "_score" : 1.22762,
        "_source" : {
          "passage_text" : "Hi planet",
          "id" : "s2"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "my-nlp-index",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 1.2251667,
        "_source" : {
          "passage_text" : "Hello world",
          "id" : "s1"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
