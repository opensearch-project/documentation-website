# Generating sparse vector embeddings automatically

Generating sparse vector embeddings automatically enables neural sparse search to function like lexical search. To take advantage of this encapsulation, set up an ingest pipeline to create and store sparse vector embeddings from document text during ingestion. At query time, input plain text, which will be automatically converted into vector embeddings for search.

Neural sparse search works as follows:

- At ingestion time, neural sparse search uses a sparse encoding model to generate sparse vector embeddings from text fields. 

- At query time, neural sparse search operates in one of two search modes: 

    - **Doc-only mode (default)**: A sparse encoding model generates sparse vector embeddings from documents at ingestion time. At query time, neural sparse search tokenizes query text and obtains the token weights from a lookup table. This approach provides faster retrieval at the cost of a slight decrease in search relevance. The query-time tokenization can be performed by the following components:
      - **A DL model analyzer (default)**: A [DL model analyzer]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/analyzers/supported-analyzers/dl-model-analyzers/) uses a built-in ML model. This approach provides faster retrieval at the cost of a slight decrease in search relevance.
      - **A custom tokenizer**: You can deploy a custom tokenizer using the [Model API]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/api/model-apis/index/) to tokenize query text. This approach provides more flexibility while maintaining consistent tokenization across your neural sparse search implementation. 

    - **Bi-encoder mode**: A sparse encoding model generates sparse vector embeddings from both documents and query text. This approach provides better search relevance at the cost of an increase in latency. 

We recommend using the default doc-only mode with a DL analyzer because it provides the best balance of performance and relevance for most use cases. 
{: tip} 

The default doc-only mode with an analyzer works as follows:

1. At ingestion time:
   - Your registered sparse encoding model generates sparse vector embeddings.
   - These embeddings are stored as token-weight pairs in your index.

2. At search time:
   - The query text is analyzed using a built-in DL model analyzer (which uses a corresponding built-in ML model tokenizer).
   - The token weights are obtained from a precomputed lookup table that's built into OpenSearch.
   - The tokenization matches what the sparse encoding model expects because they both use the same tokenization scheme.

Thus, you must choose and apply an ML model at ingestion time, but you only need to specify an analyzer (not a model) at search time.

## Sparse encoding model/analyzer compatibility

The following table lists all available models for use in doc-only mode. Each model is paired with its compatible analyzer that should be used at search time. Choose based on your language needs (English or multilingual) and performance requirements.

| Model                                                                    | Analyzer        | BEIR relevance | MIRACL relevance | Model parameters |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `amazon/neural-sparse/opensearch-neural-sparse-encoding-doc-v1`          | `bert-uncased`  | 0.490          | N/A              | 133M             |
| `amazon/neural-sparse/opensearch-neural-sparse-encoding-doc-v2-distill`  | `bert-uncased`  | 0.504          | N/A              | 67M              |
| `amazon/neural-sparse/opensearch-neural-sparse-encoding-doc-v2-mini`     | `bert-uncased`  | 0.497          | N/A              | 23M              |
| `amazon/neural-sparse/opensearch-neural-sparse-encoding-doc-v3-distill`  | `bert-uncased`  | 0.517          | N/A              | 67M              |
| `amazon/neural-sparse/opensearch-neural-sparse-encoding-multilingual-v1` | `mbert-uncased` | 0.500          | 0.629            | 168M             |

## Example: Using the default doc-only mode with an analyzer

This example uses the recommended **doc-only** mode with a **DL model analyzer**. In this mode, OpenSearch applies a sparse encoding model at ingestion time and a compatible DL model analyzer at search time. For examples of other modes, see [Using custom configurations for neural sparse search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/vector-search/ai-search/neural-sparse-custom/). 

For this example, you'll use neural sparse search with OpenSearch's built-in machine learning (ML) model hosting and ingest pipelines. Because the transformation of text to embeddings is performed within OpenSearch, you'll use text when ingesting and searching documents. 

### Prerequisites

Before you start, complete the [prerequisites]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/neural-search-tutorial/#prerequisites). 

### Step 1: Configure a sparse encoding model for ingestion

To use doc-only mode, first [choose a sparse encoding model](#sparse-encoding-modelanalyzer-compatibility) to be used at ingestion time. Then, register and deploy the model. For example, to register and deploy the `opensearch-neural-sparse-encoding-doc-v3-distill` model, use the following request:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/_register?deploy=true
{
  "name": "amazon/neural-sparse/opensearch-neural-sparse-encoding-doc-v3-distill",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "model_format": "TORCH_SCRIPT"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Registering a model is an asynchronous task. OpenSearch returns a task ID for every model you register:

```json
{
  "task_id": "aFeif4oB5Vm0Tdw8yoN7",
  "status": "CREATED"
}
```

You can check the status of the task by calling the Tasks API:

```json
GET /_plugins/_ml/tasks/aFeif4oB5Vm0Tdw8yoN7
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Once the task is complete, the task state will change to `COMPLETED` and the Tasks API response will contain the model ID of the registered model:

```json
{
  "model_id": "<model ID>",
  "task_type": "REGISTER_MODEL",
  "function_name": "SPARSE_ENCODING",
  "state": "COMPLETED",
  "worker_node": [
    "4p6FVOmJRtu3wehDD74hzQ"
  ],
  "create_time": 1694358489722,
  "last_update_time": 1694358499139,
  "is_async": true
}
```

Note the `model_id` of the model you've created; you'll need it for the following steps.

### Step 2: Create an ingest pipeline

To generate sparse vector embeddings, you need to create an [ingest pipeline]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/ingest-apis/index/) that contains a [`sparse_encoding` processor]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/ingest-apis/processors/sparse-encoding/), which will convert the text in a document field to vector embeddings. The processor's `field_map` determines the input fields from which to generate vector embeddings and the output fields in which to store the embeddings.

The following example request creates an ingest pipeline where the text from `passage_text` will be converted into sparse vector embeddings, which will be stored in `passage_embedding`. Provide the model ID of the registered model in the request:

```json
PUT /_ingest/pipeline/nlp-ingest-pipeline-sparse
{
  "description": "An sparse encoding ingest pipeline",
  "processors": [
    {
      "sparse_encoding": {
        "model_id": "<bi-encoder or doc-only model ID>",
        "prune_type": "max_ratio",
        "prune_ratio": 0.1,
        "field_map": {
          "passage_text": "passage_embedding"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

To split long text into passages, use the `text_chunking` ingest processor before the `sparse_encoding` processor. For more information, see [Text chunking]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/text-chunking/).

### Step 3: Create an index for ingestion

In order to use the sparse encoding processor defined in your pipeline, create a rank features index, adding the pipeline created in the previous step as the default pipeline. Ensure that the fields defined in the `field_map` are mapped as correct types. Continuing with the example, the `passage_embedding` field must be mapped as [`rank_features`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/field-types/supported-field-types/rank/#rank-features). Similarly, the `passage_text` field must be mapped as `text`.

The following example request creates a rank features index configured with a default ingest pipeline:

```json
PUT /my-nlp-index
{
  "settings": {
    "default_pipeline": "nlp-ingest-pipeline-sparse"
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "id": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "passage_embedding": {
        "type": "rank_features"
      },
      "passage_text": {
        "type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

To save disk space, you can exclude the embedding vector from the source as follows:

```json
PUT /my-nlp-index
{
  "settings": {
    "default_pipeline": "nlp-ingest-pipeline-sparse"
  },
  "mappings": {
    "_source": {
      "excludes": [
        "passage_embedding"
      ]
    },
    "properties": {
      "id": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "passage_embedding": {
        "type": "rank_features"
      },
      "passage_text": {
        "type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Once the `<token, weight>` pairs are excluded from the source, they cannot be recovered. Before applying this optimization, make sure you don't need the  `<token, weight>` pairs for your application.
{: .important}

### Step 4: Ingest documents into the index

To ingest documents into the index created in the previous step, send the following requests:

```json
PUT /my-nlp-index/_doc/1
{
  "passage_text": "Hello world",
  "id": "s1"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

```json
PUT /my-nlp-index/_doc/2
{
  "passage_text": "Hi planet",
  "id": "s2"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Before the document is ingested into the index, the ingest pipeline runs the `sparse_encoding` processor on the document, generating vector embeddings for the `passage_text` field. The indexed document includes the `passage_text` field, which contains the original text, and the `passage_embedding` field, which contains the vector embeddings. 


### Step 5: Search the data

To perform a neural sparse search on your index, use the `neural_sparse` query clause in [Query DSL]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/query-dsl/index/) queries. 

The following example request uses a `neural_sparse` query to search for relevant documents using a raw text query. Specify the `analyzer` compatible with the model you chose (see [Sparse encoding model/analyzer compatibility](#sparse-encoding-modelanalyzer-compatibility)):

```json
GET my-nlp-index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "neural_sparse": {
      "passage_embedding": {
        "query_text": "Hi world",
        "analyzer": "bert-uncased"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

If you don't specify an analyzer, the default `bert-uncased` analyzer is used. Thus, this query is equivalent to the preceding one:

```json
GET my-nlp-index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "neural_sparse": {
      "passage_embedding": {
        "query_text": "Hi world"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains the matching documents:

```json
{
  "took" : 688,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 2,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 30.0029,
    "hits" : [
      {
        "_index" : "my-nlp-index",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_score" : 30.0029,
        "_source" : {
          "passage_text" : "Hello world",
          "passage_embedding" : {
            "!" : 0.8708904,

            "hi" : 2.3929274,
            "worlds" : 2.7839446,
            "yes" : 0.75845814,
            "##world" : 2.5432441,
            "born" : 0.2682308,
            "nothing" : 0.8625516,
            "goodbye" : 0.17146169,

            "earth" : 2.6555297,
            "universe" : 2.0308156,
            "worldwide" : 1.3903781,
            "hello" : 6.696973,
            "so" : 0.20279501,
            "?" : 0.67785245
          },
          "id" : "s1"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index" : "my-nlp-index",
        "_id" : "2",
        "_score" : 16.480486,
        "_source" : {
          "passage_text" : "Hi planet",
          "passage_embedding" : {
            "hi" : 4.338913,
            "planets" : 2.7755864,
            "planet" : 5.0969057,
            "mars" : 1.7405145,
            "earth" : 2.6087382,
            "hello" : 3.3210192
          },
          "id" : "s2"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

To minimize disk and network I/O latency related to sparse embedding sources, you can exclude the embedding vector source from the query as follows:

```json
GET my-nlp-index/_search
{
  "_source": {
    "excludes": [
      "passage_embedding"
    ]
  },
  "query": {
    "neural_sparse": {
      "passage_embedding": {
        "query_text": "Hi world",
        "analyzer": "bert-uncased"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Bi-encoder mode

In bi-encoder mode, register and deploy a bi-encoder model to use at both ingestion and query time:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/_register?deploy=true
{
  "name": "amazon/neural-sparse/opensearch-neural-sparse-encoding-v2-distill",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "model_format": "TORCH_SCRIPT"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

After deployment, use the same `model_id` for search:

```json
GET my-nlp-index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "neural_sparse": {
      "passage_embedding": {
        "query_text": "Hi world",
        "model_id": "<bi-encoder model_id>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

For a complete example, see [Using custom configurations for neural sparse search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/vector-search/ai-search/neural-sparse-custom/).

## Doc-only mode with a custom tokenizer

You can use doc-only mode with a custom tokenizer. To deploy a tokenizer, send the following request:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/_register?deploy=true
{
  "name": "amazon/neural-sparse/opensearch-neural-sparse-tokenizer-v1",
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "model_format": "TORCH_SCRIPT"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

After deployment, use the `model_id` of the tokenizer in your query:

```json
GET my-nlp-index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "neural_sparse": {
      "passage_embedding": {
        "query_text": "Hi world",
        "model_id": "<tokenizer model_id>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

For a complete example, see [Using custom configurations for neural sparse search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/vector-search/ai-search/neural-sparse-custom/).

## Using a semantic field

Using a `semantic` field simplifies neural sparse search configuration. To use a `semantic` field, follow these steps. For more information, see [Semantic field type]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/field-types/supported-field-types/semantic/).

### Step 1: Register and deploy a sparse encoding model

First, register and deploy a sparse encoding model as described in [Step 1](#step-1-register-and-deploy-a-sparse-encoding-model).

## Step 2: Create an index with a semantic field for ingestion

The sparse encoding model configured in the previous step is used at ingestion time to generate sparse vector embeddings. When using a `semantic` field, set the `model_id` to the ID of the model used for ingestion. For doc-only mode, you can additionally specify the model to be used at query time by providing its ID in the `search_model_id` field.

The following example shows how to create an index with a `semantic` field configured in doc-only mode using a sparse encoding model. To enable automatic splitting of long text into smaller passages, set `chunking` to `true` in the semantic field configuration:

```json
PUT /my-nlp-index
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "id": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "passage_text": {
        "type": "semantic",
         "model_id": "_kPwYJcBmp4cG9LrUQsE",
         "search_model_id": "AUPwYJcBmp4cG9LrmQy8",
         "chunking": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

After creating the index, you can retrieve its mapping to verify that the embedding field was automatically created:

```json
GET /my-nlp-index/_mapping
{
   "my-nlp-index": {
      "mappings": {
         "properties": {
            "id": {
               "type": "text"
            },
            "passage_text": {
               "type": "semantic",
               "model_id": "_kPwYJcBmp4cG9LrUQsE",
               "search_model_id": "AUPwYJcBmp4cG9LrmQy8",
               "raw_field_type": "text",
               "chunking": true
            },
            "passage_text_semantic_info": {
               "properties": {
                  "chunks": {
                     "type": "nested",
                     "properties": {
                        "embedding": {
                           "type": "rank_features"
                        },
                        "text": {
                           "type": "text"
                        }
                     }
                  },
                  "model": {
                     "properties": {
                        "id": {
                           "type": "text",
                           "index": false
                        },
                        "name": {
                           "type": "text",
                           "index": false
                        },
                        "type": {
                           "type": "text",
                           "index": false
                        }
                     }
                  }
               }
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

An object field named `passage_text_semantic_info` is automatically created. It includes a `ran_features` subfield for storing the embedding, along with additional text fields for capturing model metadata.

### Step 3: Ingest documents into the index

To ingest documents into the index created in the previous step, send the following requests:

```json
PUT /my-nlp-index/_doc/1
{
  "passage_text": "Hello world",
  "id": "s1"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

```json
PUT /my-nlp-index/_doc/2
{
  "passage_text": "Hi planet",
  "id": "s2"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Before a document is ingested into the index, OpenSearch automatically chunks the text and generates sparse vector embeddings for each chunk. To verify that the embedding is generated properly, you can run a search request to retrieve the document:

```json
GET /my-nlp-index/_doc/1
{
   "_index": "my-nlp-index",
   "_id": "1",
   "_version": 1,
   "_seq_no": 0,
   "_primary_term": 1,
   "found": true,
   "_source": {
      "passage_text": "Hello world",
      "passage_text_semantic_info": {
         "chunks": [
            {
               "text": "Hello world",
               "embedding": {
                  "hi": 0.5843902,
                  ...
               }
            }
         ],
         "model": {
            "name": "amazon/neural-sparse/opensearch-neural-sparse-encoding-doc-v3-distill",
            "id": "_kPwYJcBmp4cG9LrUQsE",
            "type": "SPARSE_ENCODING"
         }
      },
      "id": "s1"
   }
}
```

## Step 3: Search the data

To search the embeddings of the semantic field, use the `neural` query clause in [Query DSL]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/query-dsl/index/) queries.

The following example uses a `neural` query to search for relevant documents using text input. You only need to specify the `semantic` field name---OpenSearch automatically rewrites the query and applies it to the underlying embedding field, appropriately handling any nested objects. There's no need to provide the `model_id` in the query because OpenSearch retrieves it from the `semantic` field's configuration in the index mapping:

```json
GET my-nlp-index/_search
{
   "_source": {
      "excludes": [
         "passage_text_semantic_info"
      ]
   },
   "query": {
      "neural": {
         "passage_text": {
            "query_text": "Hi world"
         }
      }
   }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains the matching documents:

```json
{
   "took": 19,
   "timed_out": false,
   "_shards": {
      "total": 1,
      "successful": 1,
      "skipped": 0,
      "failed": 0
   },
   "hits": {
      "total": {
         "value": 2,
         "relation": "eq"
      },
      "max_score": 6.437132,
      "hits": [
         {
            "_index": "my-nlp-index",
            "_id": "1",
            "_score": 6.437132,
            "_source": {
               "passage_text": "Hello world",
               "id": "s1"
            }
         },
         {
            "_index": "my-nlp-index",
            "_id": "2",
            "_score": 5.063226,
            "_source": {
               "passage_text": "Hi planet",
               "id": "s2"
            }
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use a built-in analyzer to tokenize the query text:

```json
GET my-nlp-index/_search
{
   "_source": {
      "excludes": [
         "passage_text_semantic_info"
      ]
   },
   "query": {
      "neural": {
         "passage_text": {
            "query_text": "Hi world",
            "semantic_field_search_analyzer": "bert-uncased"
         }
      }
   }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

To simplify the query further, you can define the `semantic_field_search_analyzer` in the `semantic` field configuration. This allows you to omit the analyzer from the query itself because OpenSearch automatically applies the configured analyzer during search.

## Accelerating neural sparse search

To learn more about improving retrieval time for neural sparse search, see [Accelerating neural sparse search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/neural-sparse-search/#accelerating-neural-sparse-search).

If you're using `semantic` fields with a `neural` query, query acceleration is currently **not supported**. You can achieve acceleration by running a `neural_sparse` query directly against the underlying `rank_features` field.

## Troubleshooting

This section contains information about resolving common issues encountered while running neural sparse search.

### Remote connector throttling exceptions

When using connectors to call a remote service such as Amazon SageMaker, ingestion and search calls sometimes fail because of remote connector throttling exceptions. 

For OpenSearch versions earlier than 2.15, a throttling exception will be returned as an error from the remote service:

```json
{
  "type": "status_exception",
  "reason": "Error from remote service: {\"message\":null}"
}
```

To mitigate throttling exceptions, decrease the maximum number of connections specified in the `max_connection` setting in the connector's [`client_config`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/remote-models/blueprints/#configuration-parameters) object. Doing so will prevent the maximum number of concurrent connections from exceeding the threshold of the remote service. You can also modify the retry settings to avoid a request spike during ingestion.
