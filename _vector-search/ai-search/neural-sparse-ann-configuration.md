# Sparse ANN configuration

This page provides comprehensive configuration guidance for sparse ANN in OpenSearch neural sparse search.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring sparse ANN, ensure you have:

- OpenSearch 3.3 or later with the neural-search plugin installed

## Step 1: Create sparse ANN index

To use sparse ANN, you must enable sparse setting at the index level by setting `"sparse": true`

Besides, you should use `sparse_vector` as the field type, because sparse ANN is designed to use sparse vectors.

In addition, there are some special parameters in a mapping field. You can specify what settings you want to use, such as `n_postings`, `cluster_ratio`, `summary_prune_ratio`, and `approximate_threshold`. More details can be seen in [sparse ANN index setting]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/field-types/supported-field-types/index/)

### Example
```json
PUT /sparse-ann-documents
{
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "sparse": true,
      "number_of_shards": 2,
      "number_of_replicas": 1
    }
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "sparse_embedding": {
        "type": "sparse_vector",
        "method": {
          "name": "seismic",
          "parameters": {
            "n_postings": 4000,
            "cluster_ratio": 0.1,
            "summary_prune_ratio": 0.4,
            "approximate_threshold": 1000000
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Step 2: Ingest data

After a sparse ANN index is successfully created, you can ingest sparse embeddings with tokens in the form of Integers into it

```json
POST _bulk
{ "create": { "_index": "sparse-ann-documents", "_id": "0" } }
{ "sparse_embedding": {"10": 0.85, "23": 1.92, "24": 0.67, "78": 2.54, "156": 0.73} }
{ "create": { "_index": "sparse-ann-documents", "_id": "1" } }
{ "sparse_embedding": {"3": 1.22, "19": 0.11, "21": 0.35, "300": 1.74, "985": 0.96} }
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

You can also use [ingestion pipeline]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ingest-pipelines/) which automatically adjusts the output format of tokens into Integer

## Step 3: Conduct a query

Now, you can prepare a query to retrieve information from the index you just built. Please note that you should not combine sparse ANN with [two-phase]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-pipelines/neural-sparse-query-two-phase-processor/) pipeline.

### Natural language query

Query sparse ANN fields using the enhanced `neural_sparse` query:

```json
GET /sparse-ann-documents/_search
{
  "query": {
    "neural_sparse": {
      "sparse_embedding": {
        "query_text": "machine learning algorithms",
        "model_id": "your_sparse_model_id",
        "method_parameters": {"heap_factor": 1.3, "cut": 6, "k": 10}
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Raw vector query
In addition, you can also prepare sparse vectors in advance so that you can send a raw vector as a query. Please note that you should use tokens in a form of Integer here instead of raw text.
```json
GET /sparse-ann-documents/_search
{
  "query": {
    "neural_sparse": {
      "sparse_embedding": {
        "query_tokens": {
          "1055": 1.7,
          "2931": 2.3
        },
        "method_parameters": {
          "heap_factor": 1.2,
          "top_n": 6,
          "k": 10
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Cluster settings

### Thread pool configuration

When building clustered inverted index structure, it requires intensive computations. Our algorithm uses a threadpool to building clusters in parallel. The default value of the threadpool is 1. You can adjust this `plugins.neural_search.sparse.algo_param.index_thread_qty` setting to tune the threadpool size to use more CPU cores to reduce index building time

```json
PUT /_cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "plugins.neural_search.sparse.algo_param.index_thread_qty": 4
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Memory and caching settings
Sparse ANN equips a circuit breaker to prevent the algorithm consuming too much memory, so users do not need to worry about affecting other OpenSearch functionalities. The default value of `circuit_breaker.limit` is $$10\%$$, and you can set a different limit value to control the total memory the algorithm will use. Once the memory reaches this limit, a cache eviction would occur and data which are used least recently will be evicted. Here is an example to call the circuit breaker cluster setting API:
```json
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "plugins.neural_search.circuit_breaker.limit": "30%"
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

A higher circuit breaker limit will allow more memory space to use, which prevents frequent cache eviction, but it may impact other OpenSearch's operation. A lower limit will guarantee more safety, but it may trigger more frequent cache eviction. More details can be seen in [Neural Search API]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/vector-search/api/neural/)

### Monitor sparse ANN

Use stats API to monitor memory usage and query stats. More details can be seen in [Neural Search API]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/vector-search/api/neural/)

## Performance tuning
Sparse ANN provides users with an opportunity to balance the trade-off between how accurate search results are and how fast search process can be. In short, you can tune balance between recall and latency with following parameter settings.
