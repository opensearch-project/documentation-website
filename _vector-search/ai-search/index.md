# AI search

AI search streamlines your workflow by generating embeddings automatically. OpenSearch converts text to vectors during indexing and querying. It creates and indexes vector embeddings for documents and then processes query text into embeddings to find and return the most relevant results.

## Prerequisite

Before using AI search, you must set up an ML model for embedding generation. When selecting a model, you have the following options:

- Use a pretrained model provided by OpenSearch. For more information, see [OpenSearch-provided pretrained models]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/pretrained-models/).

- Upload your own model to OpenSearch. For more information, see [Custom local models]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/custom-local-models/).

- Connect to a foundation model hosted on an external platform. For more information, see [Connecting to externally hosted models]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/remote-models/index/).
