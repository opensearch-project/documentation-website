# Vector search basics

_Vector search_, also known as _similarity search_ or _nearest neighbor search_, is a powerful technique for finding items that are most similar to a given input. Use cases include semantic search to understand user intent, recommendations (for example, an "other songs you might like" feature in a music application), image recognition, and fraud detection. For more background information about vector search, see [Nearest neighbor search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search).

## Vector embeddings

Unlike traditional search methods that rely on exact keyword matches, vector search uses _vector embeddings_---numerical representations of data such as text, images, or audio. These embeddings are stored as multi-dimensional vectors, capturing deeper patterns and similarities in meaning, context, or structure. For example, a large language model (LLM) can create vector embeddings from input text, as shown in the following image.

## Similarity search

A vector embedding is a vector in a high-dimensional space. Its position and orientation capture meaningful relationships between objects. Vector search finds the most similar results by comparing a query vector to stored vectors and returning the closest matches. OpenSearch uses the [k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) to efficiently identify the most similar vectors. Unlike keyword search, which relies on exact word matches, vector search measures similarity based on distance in this high-dimensional space.

In the following image, the vectors for `Wild West` and `Broncos` are closer to each other, while both are far from `Basketball`, reflecting their semantic differences.

## Calculating similarity

Vector similarity measures how close two vectors are in a multi-dimensional space, facilitating tasks like nearest neighbor search and ranking results by relevance. OpenSearch supports multiple distance metrics (_spaces_) for calculating vector similarity:  

- **L1 (Manhattan distance):** Sums the absolute differences between vector components.  
- **L2 (Euclidean distance):** Calculates the square root of the sum of squared differences, making it sensitive to magnitude.  
- **Lâˆž (Chebyshev distance):** Considers only the maximum absolute difference between corresponding vector elements.  
- **Cosine similarity:** Measures the angle between vectors, focusing on direction rather than magnitude.  
- **Inner product:** Determines similarity based on vector dot products, which can be useful for ranking.  
- **Hamming distance:** Counts differing elements in binary vectors.  
- **Hamming bit:** Applies the same principle as Hamming distance but is optimized for binary-encoded data.
