# OpenSearch Assistant for OpenSearch Dashboards
Introduced 2.12
{: .label .label-purple }

The [OpenSearch Assistant toolkit](<insert-ML-cross-ref-link>) helps you create AI-powered assistants for OpenSearch Dashboards without requiring specialized query tools or skills.

## Enabling OpenSearch Assistant

To enable **OpenSearch Assistant** in OpenSearch Dashboards, locate your copy of the `opensearch_dashboards.yml` file and set the following option:
```
assistant.chat.enabled: true
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}
Then configure the root `agent_id` through the following API:
```
PUT .plugins-ml-config/_doc/os_chat
{
    "type":"os_chat_root_agent",
    "configuration":{
        "agent_id": "your root agent id"
    }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}
Next, restart the OpenSearch Dashboards server. Following a successful restart, **OpenSearch Assistant** should appear in the top-right corner of the OpenSearch Dashboards interface. An example view is shown in the following image.

## Configuring the plugin
Go to the [Flow Framework plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/flow-framework) documentation to get the default chatbot template. You can modify this template to use your own model and customize the chatbot tools. Go to the [Getting started guide](https://github.com/opensearch-project/dashboards-assistant/blob/main/GETTING_STARTED_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions.
