# OpenSearch Assistant for OpenSearch Dashboards
Introduced 2.12
{: .label .label-purple }

The [OpenSearch Assistant toolkit]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/opensearch-assistant/) helps you create AI-powered assistants for OpenSearch Dashboards without requiring you to have specialized query tools or skills.

## Enabling OpenSearch Assistant

To enable **OpenSearch Assistant** in OpenSearch Dashboards, locate your copy of the `opensearch_dashboards.yml` file and set the following option:

```
assistant.chat.enabled: true
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Then configure the root `agent_id` through the following API:

```
PUT .plugins-ml-config/_doc/os_chat
{
    "type":"os_chat_root_agent",
    "configuration":{
        "agent_id": "your root agent id"
    }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Next, restart the OpenSearch Dashboards server. Following a successful restart, **OpenSearch Assistant** appears in the top-right corner of the OpenSearch Dashboards interface. An example view is shown in the following image.

## Configuring OpenSearch Assistant

For information about the chatbot template, review the [Flow Framework plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/flow-framework) documentation. You can modify this template to use your own model and customize the chatbot tools. See the [Getting started guide](https://github.com/opensearch-project/dashboards-assistant/blob/main/GETTING_STARTED_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions. 

For information about configuring OpenSearch Assistant through the REST API, see [OpenSearch Assistant Toolkit]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/opensearch-assistant/).

## Using OpenSearch Assistant in OpenSearch Dashboards

### Regenerate a response

Beneath the response, select the **Regenerate** button to generate an alternative answer to your original question. The new answer will replace the previous one, appearing in both the interface and the chat history.

### Suggested prompts

OpenSearch Assistant suggests prompts to help you get started, build upon your exising prompts, or explore other queries you may not have considered, among other reasons. Select a suggested prompt listed beneath the response field. A snapshot of a suggested prompt is shown in the following image.

### Understanding response generation

Learn how a response was generated by selecting the link **How was this generated?**. This link is within the available suggestions to help you understand which tools were involved in creating the response. If multiple tools were involved, each step will display the tool name and its input and output. This feature is useful for troubleshooting. A snapshot of the tool is shown in the following image.

### Sharing a conversation through Notebooks

You can use [Notebooks]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/notebooks/) to save your conversations. To use this option, select **Save to notebook** from the dropdown menu on the right-side of **OpenSearch Assistant**. Enter a name for the notebook, then select **Save**. All conversations (prompts and responses/questions and answers) between you and the large language model (LLM) will be saved to this notebook. The following snapshot shows an example interface. 

<img width="400px" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/dashboards-assistant/save-conversation-to-notebook.png" alt="Saving a conversation through Notebooks">
