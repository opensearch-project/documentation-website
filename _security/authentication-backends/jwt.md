# JSON Web Token

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are JSON-based access tokens that assert one or more claims. They are commonly used to implement single sign-on (SSO) solutions and fall in the category of token-based authentication systems. The basic information-transmission and identity-verification lifecycle for a JWT is described in the following steps:

1. A user logs in to an authentication server by providing credentials (for example, a username and password).
1. The authentication server validates the credentials.
1. The authentication server creates an access token and signs it.
1. The authentication server returns the token to the user.
1. The user stores the access token.
1. The user sends the access token alongside every request to the service that it wants to use.
1. The service verifies the token and grants or denies access.
1. With granted access, the user has access until the expiration time of the token. The expiration time is typically set by the issuer in the token's payload.

A JWT is self-contained in the sense that it carries within it all of the information necessary to verify a user. The tokens are base64-encoded, signed JSON objects.


## JWT elements

JWTs consist of three parts:

* Header
* Payload
* Signature


### Header

The header contains information about the signing mechanism being used, including the algorithm used for encoding the token. The following example shows typical properties and values for the header:

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

In this case, the header states that the message was signed using the hashing algorithm HMAC-SHA256.


### Payload

The payload of a JWT contains the [JWT claims](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-token-claims). A claim is a piece of information about a user of the token that serves as a unique identifier. This allows the issuer of the token to verify identity. Claims are name-value pairs, and a payload typically includes multiple claims. While the options for adding claims are numerous, it is a good practice to avoid adding too many and making the payload excessively large, which would defeat the purpose of the JWT being compact.

There are three types of claims:

* [Registered claims](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml#claims) are defined by the JWT specification and comprise a set of standard claims with reserved names. Some examples of these claims include token issuer (iss), expiration time (exp), and subject (sub).
* Public claims, on the other hand, are defined at the will of the parties sharing the token. They can contain arbitrary information, such as the username and the roles of the user. As a precaution, the specification advises either registering the name or, at least, ensuring that the name is [collision resistant](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-4.2) with other claims.
* Private claims provide another option for assigning custom information to the payload: for example, an email address. As such, they are also referred to as _custom_ claims. The two parties sharing the token must agree on their use because they are considered to be neither registered nor public claims. 

The following example shows these JSON properties as name-value pairs:

```json
{
  "iss": "example.com",
  "exp": 1300819380,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "roles": "admin, devops"
}
```

### Signature

The issuer of the token generates the token's signature by applying a cryptographic hash function to the base64-encoded header and payload. The client receiving the JWT decrypts and validates this signature in the final step of transmission.

These three parts---header, payload, and signature---are concatenated using periods to form a complete JWT:

```
encoded = base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload)
signature = HMACSHA256(encoded, 'secretkey');
jwt = encoded + "." + base64UrlEncode(signature)
```

Example:
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJsb2dnZWRJbkFzIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJpYXQiOjE0MjI3Nzk2Mzh9.gzSraSYS8EXBxLN_oWnFSRgCzcmJmMjLiuyu5CSpyHI
```


## Configuring JWTs

If you use a JWT as your only authentication method, disable the user cache by setting the `plugins.security.cache.ttl_minutes` property to `0`. For more information about this property, see [opensearch.yml]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security/configuration/yaml/#opensearchyml).
{: .important }

Set up an authentication domain and choose `jwt` as the HTTP authentication type. Because the tokens already contain all required information to verify the request, `challenge` must be set to `false` and `authentication_backend` to `noop`:

```yml
jwt_auth_domain:
  http_enabled: true
  transport_enabled: true
  order: 0
  http_authenticator:
    type: jwt
    challenge: false
    config:
      signing_key: "base64 encoded key"
      jwt_header: "Authorization"
      jwt_url_parameter: null
      subject_key: null
      roles_key: null
      required_audience: null
      required_issuer: null
      jwt_clock_skew_tolerance_seconds: 20
  authentication_backend:
    type: noop
```

The following table lists the configuration parameters.

Name | Description
:--- | :---
`signing_key` | The signing key(s) used to verify the token. If you use a symmetric key algorithm, this is the Base64-encoded shared secret. If you use an asymmetric algorithm, the algorithm contains the public key. To pass multiple keys, use a comma-separated list or enumerate the keys.
`jwt_header` | The HTTP header in which the token is transmitted. This is typically the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` schema,`Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Default is `Authorization`. Replacing this field with a value other than `Authorization` prevents the audit log from properly redacting the JWT header from audit messages. It is recommended that users only use  `Authorization` when using JWTs with audit logging. 
`jwt_url_parameter` | If the token is not transmitted in the HTTP header but rather as an URL parameter, define the name of the parameter here.
`subject_key` | The key in the JSON payload that stores the username. If not set, the [subject](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.2) registered claim is used. To extract a username from nested JWT claims, you can configure `subject_key` as a list.
`roles_key` | The key in the JSON payload that stores the user's roles. The value must be a comma-separated list of roles. You can configure `roles_key` as a list to extract roles from nested JWT claims.
`required_audience` | The name of the audience that the JWT must specify. You can set a single value (for example, `project1`) or multiple comma-separated values (for example, `project1,admin`). If you set multiple values, the JWT must have at least one required audience. This parameter corresponds to the [`aud` claim of the JWT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3).
`required_issuer` | The target issuer of JWT stored in the JSON payload. This corresponds to the [`iss` claim of the JWT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1).
`jwt_clock_skew_tolerance_seconds` | Sets a window of time, in seconds, to compensate for any disparity between the JWT authentication server and OpenSearch node clock times, thereby preventing authentication failures due to the misalignment. Security sets 30 seconds as the default. Use this setting to apply a custom value.

Because JWTs are self-contained and the user is authenticated at the HTTP level, no additional `authentication_backend` is needed. Set this value to `noop`.


### Symmetric key algorithms: HMAC

Hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs) are a group of algorithms that provide a way of signing messages by means of a shared key. The key is shared between the authentication server and the Security plugin. It must be configured as a base64-encoded value in the `signing_key` setting:

```yml
jwt_auth_domain:
  ...
    config:
      signing_key: "a3M5MjEwamRqOTAxOTJqZDE="
      ...
```


### Asymmetric key algorithms: RSA and ECDSA

RSA and ECDSA are asymmetric encryption and digital signature algorithms that use a public/private key pair to sign and verify tokens. This means that they use a private key for signing the token, while the Security plugin needs to know only the public key to verify it.

Because you cannot issue new tokens with the public key---and because you can make valid assumptions about the creator of the token---RSA and ECDSA are considered to be more secure than HMAC.

To use RS256, you need to configure only the (non-base64-encoded) public RSA key as the `signing_key` in the JWT configuration:

```yml
jwt_auth_domain:
  ...
    config:
      signing_key: |-
        -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
        MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQK...
        -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
      ...
```

The Security plugin automatically detects the algorithm (RSA/ECDSA). If necessary, you can break the key into multiple lines.


### Bearer authentication for HTTP requests

The most common way of transmitting a JWT in an HTTP request is to add it as an HTTP header with the bearer authentication schema:

```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
```

The default name of the header is `Authorization`. If required by your authentication server or proxy, you can also use a different HTTP header name using the `jwt_header` configuration key.

As with HTTP basic authentication, you should use HTTPS instead of HTTP when transmitting JWTs in HTTP requests.


### Query parameters for HTTP requests

Although the most common way to transmit JWTs in HTTP requests is to use a header field, the Security plugin also supports parameters. Configure the name of the `GET` parameter using the following key:

```yml
    config:
      signing_key: ...
      jwt_url_parameter: "parameter_name"
      subject_key: ...
      roles_key: ...
```

As with HTTP basic authentication, you should use HTTPS instead of HTTP.


### Validated registered claims

The following registered claims are validated automatically:

* "iat" (Issued At) Claim
* "nbf" (Not Before) Claim
* "exp" (Expiration Time) Claim


### Supported formats and algorithms

The Security plugin supports digitally signed, compact JWTs with all standard algorithms:

```
HS256: HMAC using SHA-256
HS384: HMAC using SHA-384
HS512: HMAC using SHA-512
RS256: RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5 using SHA-256
RS384: RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5 using SHA-384
RS512: RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5 using SHA-512
PS256: RSASSA-PSS using SHA-256 and MGF1 with SHA-256
PS384: RSASSA-PSS using SHA-384 and MGF1 with SHA-384
PS512: RSASSA-PSS using SHA-512 and MGF1 with SHA-512
ES256: ECDSA using P-256 and SHA-256
ES384: ECDSA using P-384 and SHA-384
ES512: ECDSA using P-521 and SHA-512
```


## Using a JWKS endpoint to validate a JWT

Validating the signature of the signed JWT is the last step in granting user access. OpenSearch validates the signature when the client sends the JWT with a REST request. The signature is verified in every authentication request.

Rather than store the cryptographic key used for validation in the local `config.yml` file's `authc` section, you can specify a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint to retrieve the key from its location on the issuer's server. This method of validating the JWT can help streamline management of public keys and certificates.

For more information about the content and format of JSON Web Keys, see [JSON Web Key (JWK) format](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517#section-4).

### Configuring JWKS endpoints for JWT authentication

You can configure JWKS endpoints directly in the JWT authentication domain. This approach provides enhanced security through automated key rotation and dynamic key management:

```yml
jwt_auth_domain:
  description: "Authenticate via JSON Web Token"
  http_enabled: true
  transport_enabled: true
  order: 0
  http_authenticator:
    type: jwt
    challenge: false
    config:
      jwks_uri: "https://example.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
      signing_key: null  # Not used when jwks_uri is specified
      jwt_header: "Authorization"
      jwt_url_parameter: null
      jwt_clock_skew_tolerance_seconds: 30
      roles_key: "roles"
      subject_key: "sub"
  authentication_backend:
    type: noop
```
{% include copy.html %}

### JWKS configuration parameters

The following table describes the JWKS-specific configuration parameters.

Name | Description | Default
:--- | :--- | :---
`jwks_uri` | The JWKS endpoint URL. When specified, `signing_key` is ignored and keys are retrieved from this endpoint. | `null`

### (Advanced) Security protection

To protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and ensure secure JWKS operations, the Security plugin provides several protective measures, including request limits, timeouts, and response size restrictions. The following table describes the available settings for securing JWKS operations.

Name | Description | Default
:--- | :--- | :---
`max_jwks_keys` | The maximum number of keys to process from the JWKS response. Set to `-1` for unlimited. | `-1`
`jwks_request_timeout_ms` | The maximum amount of time allowed for a single HTTP request to the JWKS endpoint, in milliseconds. | `5000`
`jwks_queued_thread_timeout_ms` | The maximum amount of time a request can wait in the queue before being processed, in milliseconds. | `2500`
`max_jwks_response_size_bytes` | The maximum size of JWKS endpoint responses, in bytes. | `1048576` (1 MB)
`refresh_rate_limit_count` | The maximum number of JWKS refresh requests allowed within the time window. | `10`
`refresh_rate_limit_time_window_ms` | The time window for rate limiting JWKS refresh requests, in milliseconds. | `10000` (10 seconds)

### JWT header with Key ID

When using JWKS, your JWT header must include a key ID (`kid`) that identifies the specific key to use for verification:

```json
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT",
  "kid": "V-diposfUJIk5jDBFi_QRouiVinG5PowskcSWy5EuCo"
}
```
{% include copy.html %}

The `kid` parameter is required when using JWKS endpoints and must match a key identifier in the JWKS response.

### Example JWKS response

The JWKS endpoint must return a JSON object containing an array of public keys. Each key must include metadata such as the key type (`kty`), usage (`use`), key ID (`kid`), and algorithm (`alg`):

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "RSA",
      "use": "sig",
      "kid": "V-diposfUJIk5jDBFi_QRouiVinG5PowskcSWy5EuCo",
      "alg": "RS256",
      "n": "nCJ9ve8zRv_4pdSja5i_8GgozoVZrUocD6UnMyQmh6fRBZWspoIRSGdTjcKktevnKWXlg7mqe7FIx6CdVqR5rVfM0o61_7cgxJqdNdnCXsFR8_S_98qMIJ-gxmlwE2a1X1VrCSmYh60APUGoGypm0sAsjvYTzU04LTN7K0Gip3H5qpkFD-Mxlev75WeC8WrvsfUFl6XN1h55HZW2wlYJGmbFVQx5839d8o6BxDVvQrGdN8MzLRFTMG8wiPhVDQL5NHt3vKgDnD6zT0c_S5Kz42i4bcktRRoAbR3LjDn5YbAatmfKzwOuL0XsbEnn-kgnt2aJ5GCaggukY3mMc-Bhew",
      "e": "AQAB"
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy.html %}

### Caching and performance

JWKS responses are cached to optimize performance:

- **Initial cache**: When JWKS is enabled, the system caches the JWKS endpoint response.
- **Cache refresh triggers in the following situations**: 
  - When a JWT contains a `kid` not found in the cache
  - When cache entries expire based on HTTP cache headers
  - During background refresh cycles
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents excessive requests to the JWKS endpoint (by default, 10 requests per 10-second window).

### Backward compatibility

JWT authentication supports direct JWKS endpoint configuration starting with OpenSearch 3.3. The feature maintains full backward compatibility:

- When `jwks_uri` is not specified or set to `null`, the system uses the existing static `signing_key` mechanism.
- Existing JWT configurations continue to work without modification.
- You can switch between static keys and JWKS by updating the configuration.
- When both `jwks_uri` and `signing_key` are configured, `jwks_uri` takes precedence and `signing_key` is ignored.



## Troubleshooting common issues

This section details how to troubleshoot common issues with your security configuration.


### Verify correct claims

Ensure that the JWT token contains the correct `iat` (issued at), `nbf` (not before), and `exp` (expiry) claims, all of which OpenSearch validates automatically.


### JWT URL parameter

When using the JWT URL parameter containing the default admin role `all_access` (for example, `curl http://localhost:9200?jwtToken=<jwt-token>`), the request fails and throws the following error:

```json
{
   "error":{
      "root_cause":[
         {
            "type":"security_exception",
            "reason":"no permissions for [cluster:monitor/main] and User [name=admin, backend_roles=[all_access], requestedTenant=null]"
         }
      ],
      "type":"security_exception",
      "reason":"no permissions for [cluster:monitor/main] and User [name=admin, backend_roles=[all_access], requestedTenant=null]"
   },
   "status":403
}
```

To correct this, ensure that the role `all_access` is mapped directly to the internal user and not to a backend role. To do this, navigate to **Security > Roles > all_access** and select the **Mapped users** tab. Select **Manage mapping** and add "admin" to the **Users** section.

The user should then appear on the **Mapped Users** tab.

### OpenSearch Dashboards configuration

Even though JWT URL parameter authentication works when querying OpenSearch directly, it fails when used to access OpenSearch Dashboards. 

**Solution:** Ensure the following lines are present in the `opensearch_dashboards.yml` configuration file:

```yml
opensearch_security.auth.type: "jwt"
opensearch_security.jwt.url_param: <your-param-name-here>
```
