# Security Configuration Versioning and Rollback API
**Introduced 3.3**
{: .label .label-purple }

This is an experimental feature and is not recommended for use in a production environment. For updates on the progress of the feature or if you want to leave feedback, join the discussion on the [OpenSearch forum](https://forum.opensearch.org/).    
{: .warning}

The Security Configuration Versioning and Rollback API provides version control for OpenSearch security configurations, enabling administrators to track changes, maintain audit trails, and restore previous configurations when needed.

This API automatically creates versions when security configurations change, allowing you to track the complete history of security configuration modifications, view detailed information about any previous version, and roll back to any previous configuration version, thus maintaining operational safety.

## How versioning works

The system automatically creates a new version when a security configuration change is detected, the change differs from the most recent saved version, and an administrator makes modifications through supported APIs.

Each version contains a version ID (unique identifier such as `v1`, `v2`), a configuration snapshot (complete security configuration at the time of creation), a timestamp indicating when the version was created, and user information identifying who made the change.

A new version is created **only when a change is detected** compared to the latest saved version. This prevents redundant versions and ensures meaningful version history.

## Enabling versioning

To use the security configuration versioning, you must enable it in your OpenSearch configuration. Add the following setting to your `opensearch.yml` configuration file:

```yaml
plugins.security.configurations_versions.enabled: true
```

Optionally, you can control the number of retained versions by specifying the following setting:

```yaml
plugins.security.config_version.retention_count: 10
```

The default retention count is `10` versions. When the retention limit is reached, the oldest version is automatically removed to make space for one new version.

After modifying `opensearch.yml`, restart your OpenSearch cluster for the changes to take effect. For more information, see [Experimental feature flags]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/configuring-opensearch/experimental/).

## Required permissions

Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions for the operations you want to perform.

| Operation | Required permission |
| :--- | :--- |
| View versions | `restapi:admin/view_version` |
| Roll back configuration | `restapi:admin/rollback_version` |

These permissions are included in the default `security_manager` and `all_access` roles.
These APIs use the same [access control]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security/access-control/api/#access-control-for-the-api) as all other Security APIs.
