# Managing OpenSearch Dashboards plugins

OpenSearch Dashboards provides a command line tool called `opensearch-dashboards-plugin` for managing plugins. This tool allows you to:

- List installed plugins.
- Install plugins.
- Remove an installed plugin.

## Plugin compatibility

Major, minor, and patch plugin versions must match OpenSearch major, minor, and patch versions in order to be compatible. For example, plugins versions 2.3.0.x work only with OpenSearch 2.3.0.
{: .warning}

## Prerequisites

- A compatible OpenSearch cluster
- The corresponding OpenSearch plugins [installed on that cluster]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/install/plugins/)
- The corresponding version of [OpenSearch Dashboards]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/) (for example, OpenSearch Dashboards 2.3.0 works with OpenSearch 2.3.0)

## Installing a plugin

For information about installing Dashboards plugins, see [Downloading bundled plugins for offline installation]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/plugins/#downloading-bundled-plugins-for-offline-installation).

## Viewing a list of installed plugins

To view the list of installed plugins from the command line, use the following command:

```bash
sudo bin/opensearch-dashboards-plugin list
```
{% include copy.html %}

The command returns the list of installed plugins and their versions:

```bash
alertingDashboards@3.1.0.0
anomalyDetectionDashboards@3.1.0.0
assistantDashboards@3.1.0.0
customImportMapDashboards@3.1.0.0

```

## Removing a plugin

To remove a plugin, use the following command:

```bash
sudo bin/opensearch-dashboards-plugin remove alertingDashboards
```
{% include copy.html %}

Then remove all associated entries from `opensearch_dashboards.yml` and restart OpenSearch Dashboards. 

## Updating plugins

OpenSearch Dashboards doesn't update plugins. Instead, you must [remove the old version](#removing-a-plugin), [reinstall the plugin](#installing-a-plugin), and restart OpenSearch Dashboards.

## Plugin dependencies

Some plugins extend functionality of other plugins. If a plugin has a dependency on another plugin, you must install the required dependency before installing the dependent plugin. For plugin dependencies, see the [manifest file](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/blob/main/manifests/{{site.opensearch_version}}/opensearch-dashboards-{{site.opensearch_version}}.yml). In this file, each plugin's dependencies are listed in the `depends_on` parameter.
