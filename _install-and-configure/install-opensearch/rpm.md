# RPM

Installing OpenSearch using RPM Package Manager (RPM) simplifies the process considerably compared to the [Tarball]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/install/tar/) method. Several technical considerations, such as the installation path, location of configuration files, and creation of a service managed by `systemd`, as examples, are handled automatically by the package manager.

Generally speaking, installing OpenSearch from the RPM distribution can be broken down into a few steps:

1. **Download and install OpenSearch.**
   - Install manually from an RPM package or from a YUM repository.
1. **(Optional) Test OpenSearch.**
   - Confirm that OpenSearch is able to run before you apply any custom configuration.
   - This can be done without any security (no password, no certificates) or with a demo security configuration that can be applied by a packaged script.
1. **Configure OpenSearch for your environment.**
   -  Apply basic settings to OpenSearch and start using it in your environment.

The RPM distribution provides everything you need to run OpenSearch inside Red Hat or Red Hat–based Linux Distributions, such as supported CentOS and RHEL versions, and Amazon Linux 2. If you have your own Java installation and set `JAVA_HOME` in your terminal application, macOS works, as well.

This guide assumes that you are comfortable working from the Linux command line interface (CLI). You should understand how to input commands, navigate between directories, and edit text files. Some example commands reference the `vi` text editor, but you may use any text editor available.

## Step 1: Download and install OpenSearch

### Install OpenSearch from a package

1. Download the RPM package for the desired version directly from the [OpenSearch downloads page](https://opensearch.org/downloads.html){:target='\_blank'}. The RPM package can be downloaded for both **x64** and **arm64** architectures.
1. Import the public GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) key. This key verifies that your OpenSearch instance is signed.
    ```bash
    sudo rpm --import https://artifacts.opensearch.org/publickeys/opensearch.pgp
    ```
1. From the CLI, you can install the package with `rpm` or `yum`.
   ```bash
   # Install the x64 package using yum.
   sudo yum install opensearch-{{site.opensearch_version}}-linux-x64.rpm

   # Install the x64 package using rpm.
   sudo rpm -ivh opensearch-{{site.opensearch_version}}-linux-x64.rpm

   # Install the arm64 package using yum.
   sudo yum install opensearch-{{site.opensearch_version}}-linux-x64.rpm

   # Install the arm64 package using rpm.
   sudo rpm -ivh opensearch-{{site.opensearch_version}}-linux-x64.rpm
   ```
1. After the installation succeeds, enable OpenSearch as a service.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable opensearch
    ```
1. Start OpenSearch.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start opensearch
    ```
1. Verify that OpenSearch launched correctly.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status opensearch
    ```

### Install OpenSearch from a YUM repository

YUM, the primary package management tool for Red Hat–based operating systems, allows you to download and install the RPM package from the YUM repository. 

1. Create a local repository file for OpenSearch:
   ```bash
   sudo curl -SL https://artifacts.opensearch.org/releases/bundle/opensearch/{{major_version_mask}}/opensearch-{{major_version_mask}}.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/opensearch-{{major_version_mask}}.repo
   ```
1. Clean your YUM cache to ensure a smooth installation:
   ```bash
   sudo yum clean all
   ```
1. Verify that the repository was created successfully.
    ```bash
    sudo yum repolist
    ```
1. With the repository file downloaded, list all available versions of OpenSearch:
   ```bash
   sudo yum list opensearch --showduplicates
   ```
1. Choose the version of OpenSearch you want to install: 
   - Unless otherwise indicated, the latest available version of OpenSearch is installed.
   ```bash
   sudo yum install opensearch
   ```
   - To install a specific version of OpenSearch:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install 'opensearch-{{site.opensearch_version}}'
   ```
1. During installation, the installer will present you with the GPG key fingerprint. Verify that the information matches the following:
   ```bash
   Fingerprint: c5b7 4989 65ef d1c2 924b a9d5 39d3 1987 9310 d3fc
   ```
    - If correct, enter `yes` or `y`. The OpenSearch installation continues.
1. Once complete, you can run OpenSearch.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start opensearch
    ```
1. Verify that OpenSearch launched correctly.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status opensearch
    ```

## Step 2: (Optional) Test OpenSearch

Before proceeding with any configuration, you should test your installation of OpenSearch. Otherwise, it can be difficult to determine whether future problems are due to installation issues or custom settings you applied after installation.

When OpenSearch is installed using the RPM package, some demo security settings are automatically applied. This includes self-signed TLS certificates and several users and roles. If you would like to configure these yourself, see [Set up OpenSearch in your environment](#step-3-set-up-opensearch-in-your-environment).

An OpenSearch node in its default configuration (with demo certificates and users with default passwords) is not suitable for a production environment. If you plan to use the node in a production environment, you should, at a minimum, replace the demo TLS certificates with your own TLS certificates and [update the list of internal users and passwords]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security/configuration/yaml). See [Security configuration]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security/configuration/index/) for additional guidance to ensure that your nodes are configured according to your security requirements.
{: .warning}

1. Send requests to the server to verify that OpenSearch is running. Note the use of the `--insecure` flag, which is required because the TLS certificates are self-signed.
   - Send a request to port 9200:
      ```bash
      curl -X GET https://localhost:9200 -u 'admin:admin' --insecure
      ```
      You should get a response that looks like this:
      ```bash
      {
         "name" : "hostname",
         "cluster_name" : "opensearch",
         "cluster_uuid" : "6XNc9m2gTUSIoKDqJit0PA",
         "version" : {
            "distribution" : "opensearch",
            "number" : "2.3.0",
            "build_type" : "rpm",
            "build_hash" : "6f6e84ebc54af31a976f53af36a5c69d474a5140",
            "build_date" : "2022-09-09T00:07:32.109283578Z",
            "build_snapshot" : false,
            "lucene_version" : "9.3.0",
            "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "7.10.0",
            "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "7.0.0"
         },
         "tagline" : "The OpenSearch Project: https://opensearch.org/"
      }
      ```
   - Query the plugins endpoint:
      ```bash
      curl -X GET https://localhost:9200/_cat/plugins?v -u 'admin:admin' --insecure
      ```

      The response should look like this:
      ```bash
      name     component                            version
      hostname opensearch-alerting                  2.1.0.0
      hostname opensearch-anomaly-detection         2.1.0.0
      hostname opensearch-asynchronous-search       2.1.0.0
      hostname opensearch-cross-cluster-replication 2.1.0.0
      hostname opensearch-index-management          2.1.0.0
      hostname opensearch-job-scheduler             2.1.0.0
      hostname opensearch-knn                       2.1.0.0
      hostname opensearch-ml                        2.1.0.0
      hostname opensearch-notifications             2.1.0.0
      hostname opensearch-notifications-core        2.1.0.0
      hostname opensearch-observability             2.1.0.0
      hostname opensearch-performance-analyzer      2.1.0.0
      hostname opensearch-reports-scheduler         2.1.0.0
      hostname opensearch-security                  2.1.0.0
      hostname opensearch-sql                       2.1.0.0
      ```

## Step 3: Set up OpenSearch in your environment

Users who do not have prior experience with OpenSearch may want a list of recommended settings in order to get started with the service. By default, OpenSearch is not bound to a network interface and cannot be reached by external hosts. Additionally, security settings are populated by default user names and passwords. The following recommendations will enable a user to bind OpenSearch to a network interface, create and sign TLS certificates, and configure basic authentication.

The following recommended settings will allow you to:

- Bind OpenSearch to an IP or network interface on the host.
- Set initial and maximum JVM heap sizes.
- Define an environment variable that points to the bundled JDK.
- Configure your own TLS certificates—no third-party certificate authority (CA) is required.
- Create an admin user with a custom password.

If you ran the security demo script, then you will need to manually reconfigure settings that were modified. Refer to [Security configuration]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/configuration/) for guidance before proceeding.
{:.note}

Before modifying any configuration files, it's always a good idea to save a backup copy before making changes. The backup file can be used to mitigate any issues caused by a bad configuration.
{:.tip}

1. Open `opensearch.yml`.
   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/opensearch/opensearch.yml
   ```
1. Add the following lines:
   ```bash
   # Bind OpenSearch to the correct network interface. Use 0.0.0.0
   # to include all available interfaces or specify an IP address
   # assigned to a specific interface.
   network.host: 0.0.0.0

   # Unless you have already configured a cluster, you should set
   # discovery.type to single-node, or the bootstrap checks will
   # fail when you try to start the service.
   discovery.type: single-node

   # If you previously disabled the security plugin in opensearch.yml,
   # be sure to re-enable it. Otherwise you can skip this setting.
   plugins.security.disabled: false
   ```
1. Save your changes and close the file.
1. Specify initial and maximum JVM heap sizes.
   1.  Open `jvm.options`.
         ```bash
         vi /etc/opensearch/jvm.options
         ```
   1. Modify the values for initial and maximum heap sizes. As a starting point, you should set these values to half of the available system memory. For dedicated hosts this value can be increased based on your workflow requirements.
      -  As an example, if the host machine has 8 GB of memory, then you might want to set the initial and maximum heap sizes to 4 GB:
         ```bash
         -Xms4g
         -Xmx4g
         ```
   1. Save your changes and close the file.

### Configure TLS

TLS certificates provide additional security for your cluster by allowing clients to confirm the identity of hosts and encrypt traffic between the client and host. For more information, refer to [Configure TLS Certificates]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security/configuration/tls/) and [Generate Certificates]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security/configuration/generate-certificates/), which are included in the [Security Plugin]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security/index/) documentation. For work performed in a development environment, self-signed certificates are usually adequate. This section will guide you through the basic steps required to generate your own TLS certificates and apply them to your OpenSearch host.

1. Navigate to the directory where the certificates will be stored.
   ```bash
   cd /etc/opensearch
   ```
1. Delete the demo certificates.
   ```bash
   sudo rm -f *pem
   ```
1. Generate a root certificate. This is what you will use to sign your other certificates.
   ```bash
   # Create a private key for the root certificate
   sudo openssl genrsa -out root-ca-key.pem 2048
   
   # Use the private key to create a self-signed root certificate. Be sure to
   # replace the arguments passed to -subj so they reflect your specific host.
   sudo openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key root-ca-key.pem -subj "/C=CA/ST=ONTARIO/L=TORONTO/O=ORG/OU=UNIT/CN=ROOT" -out root-ca.pem -days 730
   ```
1. Next, create the admin certificate. This certificate is used to gain elevated rights for performing administrative tasks relating to the security plugin.
   ```bash
   # Create a private key for the admin certificate.
   sudo openssl genrsa -out admin-key-temp.pem 2048

   # Convert the private key to PKCS#8.
   sudo openssl pkcs8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in admin-key-temp.pem -topk8 -nocrypt -v1 PBE-SHA1-3DES -out admin-key.pem
   
   # Create the certficiate signing request (CSR). A common name (CN) of "A" is acceptable because this certificate is
   # used for authenticating elevated access and is not tied to a host.
   sudo openssl req -new -key admin-key.pem -subj "/C=CA/ST=ONTARIO/L=TORONTO/O=ORG/OU=UNIT/CN=A" -out admin.csr
   
   # Sign the admin certificate with the root certificate and private key you created earlier.
   sudo openssl x509 -req -in admin.csr -CA root-ca.pem -CAkey root-ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -sha256 -out admin.pem -days 730
   ```
1. Create a certificate for the node being configured.
   ```bash
   # Create a private key for the node certificate.
   sudo openssl genrsa -out node1-key-temp.pem 2048
   
   # Convert the private key to PKCS#8.
   sudo openssl pkcs8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in node1-key-temp.pem -topk8 -nocrypt -v1 PBE-SHA1-3DES -out node1-key.pem
   
   # Create the CSR and replace the arguments passed to -subj so they reflect your specific host.
   # The CN should match a DNS A record for the host-do not use the hostname.
   sudo openssl req -new -key node1-key.pem -subj "/C=CA/ST=ONTARIO/L=TORONTO/O=ORG/OU=UNIT/CN=node1.dns.a-record" -out node1.csr
   
   # Create an extension file that defines a SAN DNS name for the host. This
   # should match the DNS A record of the host.
   sudo sh -c 'echo subjectAltName=DNS:node1.dns.a-record > node1.ext'

   # Sign the node certificate with the root certificate and private key that you created earlier.
   sudo openssl x509 -req -in node1.csr -CA root-ca.pem -CAkey root-ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -sha256 -out node1.pem -days 730 -extfile node1.ext
   ```
1. Remove temporary files that are no longer required.
   ```bash
   sudo rm -f *temp.pem *csr *ext
   ```
1. Make sure the remaining certificates are owned by the opensearch user.
   ```bash
   sudo chown opensearch:opensearch admin-key.pem admin.pem node1-key.pem node1.pem root-ca-key.pem root-ca.pem root-ca.srl
   ```
1. Add these certificates to `opensearch.yml` as described in [Generate Certificates]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security/configuration/generate-certificates/#add-distinguished-names-to-opensearchyml). Advanced users might also choose to append the settings using a script:
   ```bash
   #! /bin/bash

   # Before running this script, make sure to replace the CN in the 
   # node's distinguished name with a real DNS A record.

   echo "plugins.security.restapi.roles_enabled: [\"all_access\", \"security_rest_api_access\"]" | sudo tee -a /etc/opensearch/opensearch.yml
   ```
1. (Optional) Add trust for the self-signed root certificate.
   ```bash
   # Copy the root certificate to the correct directory
   sudo cp /etc/opensearch/root-ca.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/

   # Add trust
   sudo update-ca-trust
   ```

### Configure a user

Users are defined and authenticated by OpenSearch in a variety of ways. One method that does not require additional backend infrastructure is to manually configure users in `internal_users.yml`. See [YAML files]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security/configuration/yaml/) for more information about configuring users. The following steps explain how to remove all demo users except for the `admin` user and how to replace the `admin` default password using a script.

1. Navigate to the security plugins tools directory.
   ```bash
   cd /usr/share/opensearch/plugins/opensearch-security/tools
   ```
1. Run `hash.sh` to generate a new password.
   - This script will fail if a path to the JDK has not been defined.
      ```bash
      # Example output if a JDK isn't found...
      $ ./hash.sh
      **************************************************************************
      ** This tool will be deprecated in the next major release of OpenSearch **
      ** https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/issues/1755           **
      **************************************************************************
      which: no java in (/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/home/user/.local/bin:/home/user/bin)
      WARNING: nor OPENSEARCH_JAVA_HOME nor JAVA_HOME is set, will use 
      ./hash.sh: line 35: java: command not found
      ```
   - Declare an environment variable when you invoke the script in order to avoid issues:
      ```bash
      OPENSEARCH_JAVA_HOME=/usr/share/opensearch/jdk ./hash.sh
      ```
   - Enter the desired password at the prompt and make a note of the output hash.
1. Open `internal_users.yml`.
   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/opensearch/opensearch-security/internal_users.yml
   ```
1. Remove all demo users except for `admin` and replace the hash with the output provided by `hash.sh` in a previous step. The file should look similar to the following example:
   ```bash
   ---
   # This is the internal user database
   # The hash value is a bcrypt hash and can be generated with plugin/tools/hash.sh

   _meta:
      type: "internalusers"
      config_version: 2

   # Define your internal users here

   admin:
      hash: "$2y$1EXAMPLEQqwS8TUcoEXAMPLEeZ3lEHvkEXAMPLERqjyh1icEXAMPLE."
      reserved: true
      backend_roles:
      - "admin"
      description: "Admin user"
   ```

### Apply changes

Now that TLS certificates are installed and demo users were removed or assigned new passwords, the last step is to apply the configuration changes. This last configuration step requires invoking `securityadmin.sh` while OpenSearch is running on the host.

1. OpenSearch must be running for `securityadmin.sh` to apply changes. If you made changes to `opensearch.yml`, restart OpenSearch.
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart opensearch
   ```
1. Open a separate terminal session with the host and navigate to the directory containing `securityadmin.sh`.
   ```bash
   # Change to the correct directory
   cd /usr/share/opensearch/plugins/opensearch-security/tools
   ```
1. Invoke the script. See [Apply changes using securityadmin.sh]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security/configuration/security-admin/) for definitions of the arguments you must pass.
   ```bash
   # You can omit the environment variable if you declared this in your $PATH.
   OPENSEARCH_JAVA_HOME=/usr/share/opensearch/jdk ./securityadmin.sh -cd /etc/opensearch/opensearch-security/ -cacert /etc/opensearch/root-ca.pem -cert /etc/opensearch/admin.pem -key /etc/opensearch/admin-key.pem -icl -nhnv
   ```

### Verify that the service is running

OpenSearch is now running on your host with custom TLS certificates and a secure user for basic authentication. You can verify external connectivity by sending an API request to your OpenSearch node from another host.

During the previous test you directed requests to `localhost`. Now that TLS certificates have been applied and the new certificates reference your host's actual DNS record, requests to `localhost` will fail the CN check and the certificate will be considered invalid. Instead, requests should be sent to the address you specified while generating the certificate.

You should add trust for the root certificate to your client before sending requests. If you do not add trust, then you must use the `-k` option so that cURL ignores CN and root certificate validation.
{:.tip}

```bash
$ curl https://your.host.address:9200 -u admin:yournewpassword -k
{
  "name" : "hostname-here",
  "cluster_name" : "opensearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "efC0ANNMQlGQ5TbhNflVPg",

    "build_date" : "2022-06-30T21:31:04.823801692Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "9.2.0",

    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "7.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "The OpenSearch Project: https://opensearch.org/"
}
```

## Upgrade to a newer version

OpenSearch instances installed using RPM or YUM can be easily upgraded to a newer version. We recommend updating with YUM, but you can also upgrade using RPM.


### Manual upgrade with RPM 

Download the RPM package for the desired upgrade version directly from the [OpenSearch downloads page](https://opensearch.org/downloads.html){:target='\_blank'}.

Navigate to the directory containing the distribution and run the following command:
```bash
rpm -Uvh opensearch-{{site.opensearch_version}}-linux-x64.rpm
```

### YUM

To upgrade to the latest version of OpenSearch using YUM:
```bash
sudo yum update
```

 You can also upgrade to a specific OpenSearch version:
 ```bash
 sudo yum update opensearch-<version-number>
 ```
