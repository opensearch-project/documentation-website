# Configuring OpenSearch Dashboards

OpenSearch Dashboards uses the `opensearch_dashboards.yml` configuration file to read settings when you spin up a cluster. You can find `opensearch_dashboards.yml` in `/usr/share/opensearch-dashboards/config/opensearch_dashboards.yml` (Docker) or `/etc/opensearch-dashboards/opensearch_dashboards.yml` (most Linux distributions) on each node.

For information about OpenSearch Dashboards settings, see the sample [`opensearch_dashboards.yml`](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/blob/main/config/opensearch_dashboards.yml) file.
