OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards are compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Debian-based Linux distributions that use [`systemd`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd), such as Amazon Linux, and Ubuntu Long-Term Support (LTS). While OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards should work on most Linux distributions, we only test a subset. 

## Supported operating systems

The following table lists the operating system versions that we are currently testing:

OS | Version
:---------- | :-------- 
Rocky Linux | 8
Alma Linux | 8
Amazon Linux | 2/2023
Ubuntu | 20.04
Windows Server | 2019


## Change log
