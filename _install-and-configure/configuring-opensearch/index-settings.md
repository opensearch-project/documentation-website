# Index settings

Index settings can be of two types: [cluster-level settings](#cluster-level-index-settings) that affect all indexes in the cluster and [index-level settings](#index-level-index-settings) that affect individual indexes.

To learn more about static and dynamic settings, see [Configuring OpenSearch]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/configuring-opensearch/index/).

## Cluster-level index settings

OpenSearch supports the following cluster-level index settings. All settings in this list are dynamic:

- `action.auto_create_index` (Boolean): Automatically creates an index if the index doesn't already exist. Also applies any index templates that are configured. Default is `true`. 

- `action.destructive_requires_name` (Boolean): When set to `true`, you must specify the index name to delete an index. You cannot delete all indexes or use wildcards. Default is `true`. 

- `cluster.default.index.refresh_interval` (Time unit): Sets the refresh interval when the `index.refresh_interval` setting is not provided. This setting can be useful when you want to set a default refresh interval across all indexes in a cluster and support the `searchIdle` setting. You cannot set the interval lower than the `cluster.minimum.index.refresh_interval` setting. 

- `cluster.minimum.index.refresh_interval` (Time unit): Sets the minimum refresh interval and applies it to all indexes in the cluster. The `cluster.default.index.refresh_interval` setting should be higher than this setting's value. If, during index creation, the `index.refresh_interval` setting is lower than the minimum set, index creation fails. 

- `cluster.indices.close.enable` (Boolean): Enables closing of open indexes in OpenSearch. Default is `true`. 

- `indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec` (String): Limits the total inbound and outbound recovery traffic for each node. This applies to peer recoveries and snapshot recoveries. Default is `40mb`. If you set the recovery traffic value to less than or equal to `0mb`, rate limiting will be disabled, which causes recovery data to be transferred at the highest possible rate. 

- `indices.recovery.max_concurrent_file_chunks` (Integer): The number of file chunks sent in parallel for each recovery operation. Default is `2`. 

- `indices.recovery.max_concurrent_operations` (Integer): The number of operations sent in parallel for each recovery. Default is `1`. 

- `indices.recovery.max_concurrent_remote_store_streams` (Integer): The number of streams to the remote repository that can be opened in parallel when recovering a remote store index. Default is `20`. 

- `indices.time_series_index.default_index_merge_policy` (String): This setting allows you to specify the default merge policy for time-series indexes, particularly for those with an `@timestamp` field, such as data streams. The two available options are `tiered` (default) and `log_byte_size`. Using `log_byte_size` for time-series indexes is recommended for enhancing the performance of range queries with the `@timestamp` field. To override the merge policy on a per-index basis, you can use the `index.merge.policy` index setting. 

- `indices.fielddata.cache.size` (String): The maximum size of the field data cache. May be specified as an absolute value (for example, `8GB`) or a percentage of the node heap (for example, `50%`). This value is static so you must specify it in the `opensearch.yml` file. If you don't specify this setting, the maximum size is unlimited. This value should be smaller than the `indices.breaker.fielddata.limit`. For more information, see [Field data circuit breaker]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/configuring-opensearch/circuit-breaker/#field-data-circuit-breaker-settings).

## Index-level index settings

You can specify index settings at index creation. There are two types of index settings:

- [Static index-level index settings](#static-index-level-index-settings) are settings that you cannot update while the index is open. To update a static setting, you must close the index, update the setting, and then reopen the index. 
- [Dynamic index-level index settings](#dynamic-index-level-index-settings) are settings that you can update at any time.

### Specifying a setting when creating an index

When creating an index, you can specify its static or dynamic settings as follows:

```json
PUT /testindex
{
  "settings": {
    "index.number_of_shards": 1,
    "index.number_of_replicas": 2
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Static index-level index settings

OpenSearch supports the following static index-level index settings:

- `index.number_of_shards` (Integer): The number of primary shards in the index. Default is 1.

- `index.number_of_routing_shards` (Integer): The number of routing shards used to split an index.

- `index.shard.check_on_startup` (Boolean): Whether the index's shards should be checked for corruption. Available options are `false` (do not check for corruption), `checksum` (check for physical corruption), and `true` (check for both physical and logical corruption). Default is `false`.

- `index.codec` (String): Determines how the indexâ€™s stored fields are compressed and stored on disk. This setting impacts the size of the index shards and the performance of the index operations. 
    
    Valid values are: 
        
    - `default`
    - `best_compression`
    - `zstd` (OpenSearch 2.9 and later)
    - `zstd_no_dict`(OpenSearch 2.9 and later)
        
    For `zstd` and `zstd_no_dict`, you can specify the compression level in the `index.codec.compression_level` setting. For more information, see [Index codec settings]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/im-plugin/index-codecs/). Optional. Default is `default`.

- `index.codec.compression_level` (Integer): The compression level setting provides a tradeoff between compression ratio and speed. A higher compression level results in a higher compression ratio (smaller storage size) with a tradeoff in speed (slower compression and decompression speeds lead to greater indexing and search latencies). Can only be specified if `index.codec` is set to `zstd` and `zstd_no_dict` compression levels in OpenSearch 2.9 and later. Valid values are integers in the [1, 6] range. For more information, see [Index codec settings]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/im-plugin/index-codecs/). Optional. Default is 3. 

- `index.routing_partition_size` (Integer): The number of shards a custom routing value can go to. Routing helps an imbalanced cluster by relocating values to a subset of shards rather than a single shard. To enable routing, set this value to greater than 1 but less than `index.number_of_shards`. Default is 1.

- `index.soft_deletes.retention_lease.period` (Time unit): The maximum amount of time to retain a shard's history of operations. Default is `12h`.

- `index.load_fixed_bitset_filters_eagerly` (Boolean): Whether OpenSearch should preload cached filters. Available options are `true` and `false`. Default is `true`.

- `index.hidden` (Boolean): Whether the index should be hidden. Hidden indexes are not returned as part of queries that have wildcards. Available options are `true` and `false`. Default is `false`.

- `index.merge.policy` (String): This setting controls the merge policy for the Lucene segments. The available options are `tiered` and `log_byte_size`. The default is `tiered`, but for time-series data, such as log events, we recommend that you use the `log_byte_size` merge policy, which can improve query performance when conducting range queries on the `@timestamp` field. We recommend that you not change the merge policy of an existing index. Instead, configure this setting when creating a new index.

### Updating a static index setting

You can update a static index setting only on a closed index. The following example demonstrates updating the index codec setting.

First, close an index: 

```json
POST /testindex/_close
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Then update the settings by sending a request to the `_settings` endpoint:

```json
PUT /testindex/_settings
{
  "index": {
    "codec": "zstd_no_dict",
    "codec.compression_level": 3
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Last, reopen the index to enable read and write operations:

```json
POST /testindex/_open
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

For more information about updating settings, including supported query parameters, see [Update settings]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/index-apis/update-settings/).

### Dynamic index-level index settings

OpenSearch supports the following dynamic index-level index settings:

- `index.number_of_replicas` (Integer): The number of replica shards each primary shard should have. For example, if you have 4 primary shards and set `index.number_of_replicas` to 3, the index has 12 replica shards. Default is 1.

- `index.auto_expand_replicas` (String): Whether the cluster should automatically add replica shards based on the number of data nodes. Specify a lower bound and upper limit (for example, 0--9) or `all` for the upper limit. For example, if you have 5 data nodes and set `index.auto_expand_replicas` to 0--3, then the cluster does not automatically add another replica shard. However, if you set this value to `0-all` and add 2 more nodes for a total of 7, the cluster will expand to now have 6 replica shards. Default is disabled.

- `index.search.idle.after` (Time unit): The amount of time a shard should wait for a search or get request until it goes idle. Default is `30s`.

- `index.refresh_interval` (Time unit): How often the index should refresh, which publishes its most recent changes and makes them available for searching. Can be set to `-1` to disable refreshing. Default is `1s`.

- `index.max_result_window` (Integer): The maximum value of `from` + `size` for searches of the index. `from` is the starting index to search from, and `size` is the number of results to return. Default is 10000.

- `index.max_inner_result_window` (Integer): The maximum value of `from` + `size` that specifies the number of returned nested search hits and most relevant document aggregated during the query. `from` is the starting index to search from, and `size` is the number of top hits to return. Default is 100.

- `index.max_rescore_window` (Integer): The maximum value of `window_size` for rescore requests to the index. Rescore requests reorder the index's documents and return a new score, which can be more precise. Default is the same as `index.max_inner_result_window` or 10000 by default.

- `index.max_docvalue_fields_search` (Integer): The maximum number of `docvalue_fields` allowed in a query. Default is 100.

- `index.max_script_fields` (Integer): The maximum number of `script_fields` allowed in a query. Default is 32.

- `index.max_ngram_diff` (Integer): The maximum difference between `min_gram` and `max_gram` values for the `NGramTokenizer` and `NGramTokenFilter`. Default is 1.

- `index.max_shingle_diff` (Integer): The maximum difference between `max_shingle_size` and `min_shingle_size` to feed into the `shingle` token filter. Default is 3.

- `index.max_refresh_listeners` (Integer): The maximum number of refresh listeners each shard is allowed to have.

- `index.analyze.max_token_count` (Integer): The maximum number of tokens that can be returned from the `_analyze` API operation. Default is 10000.

- `index.highlight.max_analyzed_offset` (Integer): The number of characters a highlight request can analyze. Default is 1000000.

- `index.max_terms_count` (Integer): The maximum number of terms a terms query can accept. Default is 65536.

- `index.max_regex_length` (Integer): The maximum character length of regex that can be in a regexp query. Default is 1000.

- `index.query.default_field` (List): A field or list of fields that OpenSearch uses in queries in case a field isn't specified in the parameters.

- `index.routing.allocation.enable` (String): Specifies options for the indexâ€™s shard allocation. Available options are `all` (allow allocation for all shards), `primaries` (allow allocation only for primary shards), `new_primaries` (allow allocation only for new primary shards), and `none` (do not allow allocation). Default is `all`.

- `index.routing.rebalance.enable` (String): Enables shard rebalancing for the index. Available options are `all` (allow rebalancing for all shards), `primaries` (allow rebalancing only for primary shards), `replicas` (allow rebalancing only for replicas), and `none` (do not allow rebalancing). Default is `all`.

- `index.gc_deletes` (Time unit): The amount of time to retain a deleted document's version number. Default is `60s`.

- `index.default_pipeline` (String): The default ingest node pipeline for the index. If the default pipeline is set and the pipeline does not exist, then index requests fail. The pipeline name `_none` specifies that the index does not have an ingest pipeline.

- `index.final_pipeline` (String): The final ingest node pipeline for the index. If the final pipeline is set and the pipeline does not exist, then index requests fail. The pipeline name `_none` specifies that the index does not have an ingest pipeline.

### Updating a dynamic index setting

You can update a dynamic index setting at any time through the API. For example, to update the refresh interval, use the following request:

```json
PUT /testindex/_settings
{
  "index": {
    "refresh_interval": "2s"
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}
