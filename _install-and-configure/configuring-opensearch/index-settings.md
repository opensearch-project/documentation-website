# Index settings

Index settings can be of two types: [cluster-level settings](#cluster-level-index-settings) that affect all indexes in the cluster and [index-level settings](#index-level-index-settings) that affect individual indexes.

To learn more about static and dynamic settings, see [Configuring OpenSearch]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/configuring-opensearch/index/).

## Cluster-level index settings

OpenSearch supports the following cluster-level index settings. All settings in this list are dynamic:

- `action.auto_create_index` (Boolean): Automatically creates an index if the index doesn't already exist. Also applies any index templates that are configured. Default is `true`. 

- `action.destructive_requires_name` (Boolean): When set to `true`, you must specify the index name to delete an index. You cannot delete all indexes or use wildcards. Default is `true`. 

- `cluster.default.index.refresh_interval` (Time unit): Sets the refresh interval when the `index.refresh_interval` setting is not provided. This setting can be useful when you want to set a default refresh interval across all indexes in a cluster and support the `searchIdle` setting. You cannot set the interval lower than the `cluster.minimum.index.refresh_interval` setting. 

- `cluster.minimum.index.refresh_interval` (Time unit): Sets the minimum refresh interval and applies it to all indexes in the cluster. The `cluster.default.index.refresh_interval` setting should be higher than this setting's value. If, during index creation, the `index.refresh_interval` setting is lower than the minimum set, index creation fails. 

- `cluster.indices.close.enable` (Boolean): Enables closing of open indexes in OpenSearch. Default is `true`. 

- `indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec` (String): Limits the total inbound and outbound recovery traffic for each node. This applies to peer recoveries and snapshot recoveries. Default is `40mb`. If you set the recovery traffic value to less than or equal to `0mb`, rate limiting will be disabled, which causes recovery data to be transferred at the highest possible rate. 

- `indices.recovery.max_concurrent_file_chunks` (Integer): The number of file chunks sent in parallel for each recovery operation. Default is `2`. 

- `indices.recovery.max_concurrent_operations` (Integer): The number of operations sent in parallel for each recovery. Default is `1`. 

- `indices.recovery.max_concurrent_remote_store_streams` (Integer): The number of streams to the remote repository that can be opened in parallel when recovering a remote store index. Default is `20`. 

- `indices.replication.max_bytes_per_sec` (String): Limits the total inbound and outbound replication traffic for each node. If a value is not specified in the configured value the `indices.recovery.max_bytes_per_sec` setting is used, which defaults to 40 mb. If you set the replication traffic value to less than or equal to 0 mb, rate limiting is disabled, which causes replication data to be transferred at the highest possible rate.

- `indices.fielddata.cache.size` (String): The maximum size of the field data cache. May be specified as an absolute value (for example, `8GB`) or a percentage of the node heap (for example, `50%`). This value is static so you must specify it in the `opensearch.yml` file. If you don't specify this setting, the maximum size is unlimited. This value should be smaller than the `indices.breaker.fielddata.limit`. For more information, see [Field data circuit breaker]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/configuring-opensearch/circuit-breaker/#field-data-circuit-breaker-settings).

- `cluster.remote_store.index.path.type` (String): The path strategy for the data stored in the remote store. This setting is effective only for remote-store-enabled clusters. This setting supports the following values:
  - `fixed`: Stores the data in path structure `<repository_base_path>/<index_uuid>/<shard_id>/`.
  - `hashed_prefix`: Stores the data in path structure `hash(<shard-data-idenitifer>)/<repository_base_path>/<index_uuid>/<shard_id>/`.
  - `hashed_infix`: Stores the data in path structure `<repository_base_path>/hash(<shard-data-idenitifer>)/<index_uuid>/<shard_id>/`.
  `shard-data-idenitifer` is characterized by the index_uuid, shard_id, kind of data (translog, segments), and type of data (data, metadata, lock_files).
  Default is `fixed`.

- `cluster.remote_store.index.path.hash_algorithm` (String): The hash function used to derive the hash value when `cluster.remote_store.index.path.type` is set to `hashed_prefix` or `hashed_infix`. This setting is effective only for remote-store-enabled clusters. This setting supports the following values:
  - `fnv_1a_base64`: Uses the FNV1a hash function and generates a url-safe 20-bit base64-encoded hash value.
  - `fnv_1a_composite_1`: Uses the FNV1a hash function and generates a custom encoded hash value that scales well with most remote store options. The FNV1a function generates 64-bit value. The custom encoding uses the most significant 6 bits to create a url-safe base64 character and the next 14 bits to create a binary string. Default is `fnv_1a_composite_1`.

- `cluster.remote_store.translog.transfer_timeout` (Time unit): Controls the timeout value while uploading translog and checkpoint files during a sync to the remote store. This setting is applicable only for remote-store-enabled clusters. Default is `30s`.

- `cluster.remote_store.index.segment_metadata.retention.max_count` (Integer): Controls the minimum number of metadata files to keep in the segment repository on a remote store. A value below `1` disables the deletion of stale segment metadata files. Default is `10`.


## Index-level index settings

You can specify index settings at index creation. There are two types of index settings:

- [Static index-level index settings](#static-index-level-index-settings) are settings that you cannot update while the index is open. To update a static setting, you must close the index, update the setting, and then reopen the index. 
- [Dynamic index-level index settings](#dynamic-index-level-index-settings) are settings that you can update at any time.

### Specifying a setting when creating an index

When creating an index, you can specify its static or dynamic settings as follows:

```json
PUT /testindex
{
  "settings": {
    "index.number_of_shards": 1,
    "index.number_of_replicas": 2
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Static index-level index settings

OpenSearch supports the following static index-level index settings:

- `index.number_of_shards` (Integer): The number of primary shards in the index. Default is 1.

- `index.number_of_routing_shards` (Integer): The number of routing shards used to split an index.

- `index.shard.check_on_startup` (Boolean): Whether the index's shards should be checked for corruption. Available options are `false` (do not check for corruption), `checksum` (check for physical corruption), and `true` (check for both physical and logical corruption). Default is `false`.

- `index.codec` (String): Determines how the indexâ€™s stored fields are compressed and stored on disk. This setting impacts the size of the index shards and the performance of the index operations. 
    
    Valid values are: 
        
    - `default`
    - `best_compression`
    - `zstd` (OpenSearch 2.9 and later)
    - `zstd_no_dict`(OpenSearch 2.9 and later)
    - `qat_lz4` (OpenSearch 2.14 and later, on supported systems)
    - `qat_deflate` (OpenSearch 2.14 and later, on supported systems)
        
For `zstd`, `zstd_no_dict`, `qat_lz4`, and `qat_deflate`, you can specify the compression level in the `index.codec.compression_level` setting. For more information, see [Index codec settings]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/im-plugin/index-codecs/). Optional. Default is `default`.

- `index.codec.compression_level` (Integer): The compression level setting provides a trade-off between compression ratio and speed. A higher compression level results in a higher compression ratio (smaller storage size), but slower compression and decompression speeds lead to higher indexing and search latencies. This setting can only be specified if `index.codec` is set to `zstd` and `zstd_no_dict` in OpenSearch 2.9 and later or `qat_lz4` and `qat_deflate` in OpenSearch 2.14 and later. Valid values are integers in the [1, 6] range. For more information, see [Index codec settings]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/im-plugin/index-codecs/). Optional. Default is 3.

- `index.codec.qatmode` (String): The hardware acceleration mode used for the `qat_lz4` and `qat_deflate` compression codecs. Valid values are `auto` and `hardware`. For more information, see [Index codec settings]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/im-plugin/index-codecs/). Optional. Default is `auto`. 

        


- `index.routing_partition_size` (Integer): The number of shards a custom routing value can go to. Routing helps an imbalanced cluster by relocating values to a subset of shards rather than a single shard. To enable routing, set this value to greater than 1 but less than `index.number_of_shards`. Default is 1.

- `index.soft_deletes.retention_lease.period` (Time unit): The maximum amount of time to retain a shard's history of operations. Default is `12h`.

- `index.load_fixed_bitset_filters_eagerly` (Boolean): Whether OpenSearch should preload cached filters. Available options are `true` and `false`. Default is `true`.

- `index.hidden` (Boolean): Whether the index should be hidden. Hidden indexes are not returned as part of queries that have wildcards. Available options are `true` and `false`. Default is `false`.

- `index.merge.policy` (String): This setting controls the merge policy for the Lucene segments. The available options are `tiered` and `log_byte_size`. The default is `tiered`, but for time-series data, such as log events, we recommend that you use the `log_byte_size` merge policy, which can improve query performance when conducting range queries on the `@timestamp` field. We recommend that you not change the merge policy of an existing index. Instead, configure this setting when creating a new index.

- `index.merge_on_flush.enabled` (Boolean): This setting controls Apache Lucene's merge-on-refresh feature that aims to reduce the number of segments by performing merges _on refresh_ (or in terms of OpenSearch, _on flush_). Default is `true`.

- `index.merge_on_flush.max_full_flush_merge_wait_time` (Time unit): This setting sets the amount of time to wait for merges when `index.merge_on_flush.enabled` is enabled. Default is `10s`.

- `index.merge_on_flush.policy` (default | merge-on-flush): This setting controls which merge policy should be used when `index.merge_on_flush.enabled` is enabled. Default is `default`.

- `index.check_pending_flush.enabled` (Boolean): This setting controls the Apache Lucene `checkPendingFlushOnUpdate` index writer setting, which specifies whether an indexing thread should check for pending flushes on an update in order to flush indexing buffers to disk. Default is `true`.

### Updating a static index setting

You can update a static index setting only on a closed index. The following example demonstrates updating the index codec setting.

First, close an index: 

```json
POST /testindex/_close
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Then update the settings by sending a request to the `_settings` endpoint:

```json
PUT /testindex/_settings
{
  "index": {
    "codec": "zstd_no_dict",
    "codec.compression_level": 3
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Last, reopen the index to enable read and write operations:

```json
POST /testindex/_open
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

For more information about updating settings, including supported query parameters, see [Update settings]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/index-apis/update-settings/).

### Dynamic index-level index settings

OpenSearch supports the following dynamic index-level index settings:

- `index.number_of_replicas` (Integer): The number of replica shards each primary shard should have. For example, if you have 4 primary shards and set `index.number_of_replicas` to 3, the index has 12 replica shards. Default is 1.

- `index.auto_expand_replicas` (String): Whether the cluster should automatically add replica shards based on the number of data nodes. Specify a lower bound and upper limit (for example, 0--9) or `all` for the upper limit. For example, if you have 5 data nodes and set `index.auto_expand_replicas` to 0--3, then the cluster does not automatically add another replica shard. However, if you set this value to `0-all` and add 2 more nodes for a total of 7, the cluster will expand to now have 6 replica shards. Default is disabled.

- `index.search.idle.after` (Time unit): The amount of time a shard should wait for a search or get request until it goes idle. Default is `30s`.

- `index.search.default_pipeline` (String): The name of the search pipeline that is used if no pipeline is explicitly set when searching an index. If a default pipeline is set and the pipeline doesn't exist, then the index requests fail. Use the pipeline name `_none` to specify no default search pipeline. For more information, see [Default search pipeline]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-pipelines/using-search-pipeline/#default-search-pipeline).

- `index.refresh_interval` (Time unit): How often the index should refresh, which publishes its most recent changes and makes them available for searching. Can be set to `-1` to disable refreshing. Default is `1s`.

- `index.max_result_window` (Integer): The maximum value of `from` + `size` for searches of the index. `from` is the starting index to search from, and `size` is the number of results to return. Default is 10000.

- `index.max_inner_result_window` (Integer): The maximum value of `from` + `size` that specifies the number of returned nested search hits and most relevant document aggregated during the query. `from` is the starting index to search from, and `size` is the number of top hits to return. Default is 100.

- `index.max_rescore_window` (Integer): The maximum value of `window_size` for rescore requests to the index. Rescore requests reorder the index's documents and return a new score, which can be more precise. Default is the same as `index.max_inner_result_window` or 10000 by default.

- `index.max_docvalue_fields_search` (Integer): The maximum number of `docvalue_fields` allowed in a query. Default is 100.

- `index.max_script_fields` (Integer): The maximum number of `script_fields` allowed in a query. Default is 32.

- `index.max_ngram_diff` (Integer): The maximum difference between `min_gram` and `max_gram` values for the `NGramTokenizer` and `NGramTokenFilter`. Default is 1.

- `index.max_shingle_diff` (Integer): The maximum difference between `max_shingle_size` and `min_shingle_size` to feed into the `shingle` token filter. Default is 3.

- `index.max_refresh_listeners` (Integer): The maximum number of refresh listeners each shard is allowed to have.

- `index.analyze.max_token_count` (Integer): The maximum number of tokens that can be returned from the `_analyze` API operation. Default is 10000.

- `index.highlight.max_analyzed_offset` (Integer): The number of characters a highlight request can analyze. Default is 1000000.

- `index.max_terms_count` (Integer): The maximum number of terms a terms query can accept. Default is 65536.

- `index.max_regex_length` (Integer): The maximum character length of regex that can be in a regexp query. Default is 1000.

- `index.query.default_field` (List): A field or list of fields that OpenSearch uses in queries in case a field isn't specified in the parameters.

- `index.query.max_nested_depth` (Integer): The maximum number of nesting levels for `nested` queries. Default is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. Minimum is 1 (single `nested` query).

- `index.routing.allocation.enable` (String): Specifies options for the indexâ€™s shard allocation. Available options are `all` (allow allocation for all shards), `primaries` (allow allocation only for primary shards), `new_primaries` (allow allocation only for new primary shards), and `none` (do not allow allocation). Default is `all`.

- `index.routing.rebalance.enable` (String): Enables shard rebalancing for the index. Available options are `all` (allow rebalancing for all shards), `primaries` (allow rebalancing only for primary shards), `replicas` (allow rebalancing only for replicas), and `none` (do not allow rebalancing). Default is `all`.

- `index.gc_deletes` (Time unit): The amount of time to retain a deleted document's version number. Default is `60s`.

- `index.default_pipeline` (String): The default ingest node pipeline for the index. If the default pipeline is set and the pipeline does not exist, then index requests fail. The pipeline name `_none` specifies that the index does not have an ingest pipeline.

- `index.final_pipeline` (String): The final ingest node pipeline for the index. If the final pipeline is set and the pipeline does not exist, then index requests fail. The pipeline name `_none` specifies that the index does not have an ingest pipeline.

- `index.optimize_doc_id_lookup.fuzzy_set.enabled` (Boolean): This setting controls whether `fuzzy_set` should be enabled in order to optimize document ID lookups in index or search calls by using an additional data structure, in this case, the Bloom filter data structure. Enabling this setting improves performance for upsert and search operations that rely on document IDs by creating a new data structure (Bloom filter). The Bloom filter allows for the handling of negative cases (that is, IDs being absent in the existing index) through faster off-heap lookups. Note that creating a Bloom filter requires additional heap usage during indexing time. Default is `false`.

- `index.optimize_doc_id_lookup.fuzzy_set.false_positive_probability` (Double): Sets the false-positive probability for the underlying `fuzzy_set` (that is, the Bloom filter). A lower false-positive probability ensures higher throughput for upsert and get operations but results in increased storage and memory use. Allowed values range between `0.01` and `0.50`. Default is `0.20`.

### Updating a dynamic index setting

You can update a dynamic index setting at any time through the API. For example, to update the refresh interval, use the following request:

```json
PUT /testindex/_settings
{
  "index": {
    "refresh_interval": "2s"
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

For more information about updating settings, including supported query parameters, see [Update settings]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/index-apis/update-settings/).
