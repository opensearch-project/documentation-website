# Keyword search

By default, OpenSearch calculates document scores using the [Okapi BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) algorithm. BM25 is a keyword-based algorithm that performs lexical search for words that appear in the query. 

When determining a document's relevance, BM25 considers [term frequency/inverse document frequency (TF/IDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf):

- _Term frequency_ stipulates that documents in which the search term appears more frequently are more relevant. 

- _Inverse document frequency_ gives less weight to the words that commonly appear in all documents in the corpus (for example, articles like "the"). 

## Example

The following example query searches for the words `long live king` in the `shakespeare` index:

```json
GET shakespeare/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "text_entry": "long live king"
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains the matching documents, each with a relevance score in the `_score` field:

```json
{
  "took": 113,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,

## Similarity algorithms

The following table lists the supported similarity algorithms.

Algorithm | Description
`BM25` | The default OpenSearch [Okapi BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) similarity algorithm. 
`LegacyBM25` (Deprecated) | The older [LegacyBM25Similarity](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/lucene/similarity/LegacyBM25Similarity.java) implementation. Kept for backward compatibility.
`boolean` | Assigns terms a score equal to their boost value. Use `boolean` similarity when you want the document scores to be based on the binary value of whether the terms match.


### Important changes to BM25 scoring in OpenSearch 3.0

In OpenSearch 3.0, the default similarity algorithm changed from `LegacyBM25Similarity` to Lucene's native `BM25Similarity`.

This change improves alignment with Lucene standards and simplifies scoring behavior, but it introduces an important difference:

- In `LegacyBM25Similarity`, scores included an extra constant factor of `k‚ÇÅ + 1` in the numerator of the `BM25` formula.

- In `BM25Similarity`, this constant was removed for cleaner normalization (see [BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) and the corresponding [Lucene GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/lucene/issues/9609)).

- Scores produced by `BM25Similarity` are lower than those produced by `LegacyBM25Similarity`, typically by a factor of about `2.2`.

- Ranking is unaffected because the constant factor does not change the relative order of documents.

- To retain the old scoring behavior, explicitly configure your field or index to use `LegacyBM25` (see [Configuring legacy BM25 similarity](#configuring-legacy-bm25-similarity)).


## Specifying similarity

You can specify the similarity algorithm in the `similarity` parameter when configuring mappings at the field level.

For example, the following query specifies the `boolean` similarity for the `boolean_field`. The `bm25_field` is assigned the default `BM25` similarity:

```json
PUT /testindex
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "bm25_field": { 
        "type": "text"
      },
      "boolean_field": {
        "type": "text",
        "similarity": "boolean" 
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Configuring BM25 similarity 

You can configure BM25 similarity parameters at the index level as follows:

```json
PUT /testindex
{
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "similarity": {
        "custom_similarity": {
          "type": "BM25",
          "k1": 1.2,
          "b": 0.75,
          "discount_overlaps": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`BM25` similarity supports the following parameters.

Parameter | Data type | Description
`k1` | Float | Determines non-linear term frequency normalization (saturation) properties. The default value is `1.2`.
`b` | Float | Determines the degree to which document length normalizes TF values. The default value is `0.75`.
`discount_overlaps` | Boolean | Determines whether overlap tokens (tokens with zero position increment) are ignored when computing the norm. Default is `true` (overlap tokens do not count when computing the norm). 


## Configuring legacy BM25 similarity 

If you want to retain the older similarity behavior, specify `LegacyBM25` as the similarity `type`:

```json
PUT /testindex
{
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "similarity": {
        "default": {
          "type": "LegacyBM25",
          "k1": 1.2,
          "b": 0.75
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
