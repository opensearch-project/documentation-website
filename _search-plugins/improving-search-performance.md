# Improving search performance

OpenSearch offers several ways to improve search performance:

- Run resource-intensive queries asynchronously with [asynchronous search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/async/).

- Search segments concurrently using [concurrent segment search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/concurrent-segment-search/).

- Improve aggregation performance using a [star-tree index]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/star-tree-index/).
