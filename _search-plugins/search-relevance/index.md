# Search relevance

Search relevance evaluates the accuracy of the search results returned by a query. The higher the relevance, the better the search engine. 

OpenSearch provides the following search relevance features:

- [Comparing search results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-relevance/compare-search-results/) from two queries side by side in OpenSearch Dashboards. 

- [Reranking search results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-relevance/reranking-search-results/) using a cross-encoder reranker. 

- [Query rewriting]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-relevance/query-rewriting/).
