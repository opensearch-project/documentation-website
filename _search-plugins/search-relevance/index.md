# Search relevance

Search relevance evaluates the accuracy of the search results returned by a query. The higher the relevance, the better the search engine.

OpenSearch provides the following search relevance features:

- [Search Relevance Workbench]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-relevance/using-search-relevance-workbench/): A suite of tools that support search quality improvements through experimentation.

- [Reranking search results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-relevance/reranking-search-results/) using a cross-encoder reranker.

- [Query rewriting]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-relevance/query-rewriting/).
