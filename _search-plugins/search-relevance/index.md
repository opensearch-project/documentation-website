# Search relevance

Search relevance evaluates the accuracy of the search results returned by a query. The higher the relevance, the better the search engine. 

OpenSearch provides the following search relevance features:

- [Compare Search Results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-relevance/compare-search-results/) in OpenSearch Dashboards lets you compare results from two queries side by side. 

- [Querqy]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/querqy/) offers query rewriting capability.
