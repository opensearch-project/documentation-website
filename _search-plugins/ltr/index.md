# Learning to Rank

The Learning to Rank plugin for OpenSearch enables you to use machine learning (ML) and behavioral data to fine-tune the relevance of documents. It uses models from the [XGBoost](https://xgboost.ai/) and [RankLib](https://lemurproject.org/ranklib.php) libraries. These models rescore the search results, considering query-dependent features such as click-through data or field matches, which can further improve relevance.

The term _learning to rank_ is abbreviated as LTR throughout the OpenSearch documentation when the term is used in a general sense. For the plugin developer documentation, see [opensearch-learning-to-rank-base](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-learning-to-rank-base).
