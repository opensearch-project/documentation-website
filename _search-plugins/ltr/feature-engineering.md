# Feature Engineering

You've seen how to add features to feature sets. We want to show you
how to address common feature engineering tasks that come up when
developing a learning to rank solution.

## Getting Raw Term Statistics

Many learning to rank solutions use raw term statistics in training.
For example, the total term frequency for a term, the document
frequency, and other statistics. Luckily, OpenSearch LTR comes
with a query primitive, `match_explorer`, that extracts these
statistics for you for a set of terms. In its simplest form,
`match_explorer` lets you specify a statistic you\'re interested in
and a match you'd like to explore. For example:

```json
POST tmdb/_search
{
    "query": {
        "match_explorer": {
            "type": "max_raw_df",
            "query": {
                "match": {
                    "title": "rambo rocky"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This query returns the highest document frequency between the two terms.

A large number of statistics are available. The `type` parameter can
be prepended with the operation to be performed across terms for the
statistic `max`, `min`, `sum`, and `stddev`.

The statistics available include:
  - `raw_df` -- the direct document frequency for a term. So if
rambo occurs in 3 movie titles, this is 3.
  - `classic_idf` -- the IDF calculation of the classic similarity
`log((NUM_DOCS+1)/(raw_df+1)) + 1`.
  - `raw_ttf` -- the total term frequency for the term across the
index. So if rambo is mentioned a total of 100 times in the overview
field, this would be 100.
  -   `raw_tf` -- the term frequency for a document. So if rambo
    occurs in 3 in movie synopsis in same document, this is 3.

Putting the operation and the statistic together, you can see some
examples. To get stddev of classic_idf, you would write
`stddev_classic_idf`. To get the minimum total term frequency,
you'd write `min_raw_ttf`.

### Term position statistics

The `type` parameter can be prepended with the operation to be
performed across term position for the statistic `min`, `max` and
`avg`. For any of the cases, 0 will be returned if there isn’t any occurrence of the terms in the document.

The statistics available include, e.g. using the query “dance monkey” we have:

  - `min_raw_tp` -- return the minimum occurrence, i.e. the first
one, of any term on the query. So if dance occurs at positions [2,5 ,9], 
and monkey occurs at positions [1, 4] in a text in the same document, the minimum is 1.                                     |
  - `max_raw_tp` -- return the maximum occurrence, i.e. the last
one, of any term on the query. So if dance occurs at positions [2, 5 ,9] 
and monkey occurs at positions [1, 4\] in a text in the same
document, the maximum is 9.
  -  `avg_raw_tp` -- return the average of all occurrence of the
terms on the query. So if dance occurs at positions [2, 5 ,9]
its average is `5.33`, and monkey has average `2.5` for
positions [1, 4]. So the returned average is `3.91`, computed
by `(5.33 + 2.5)/2`.

Finally a special stat exists for only counting the number of search
terms. That stat is `unique_terms_count`.

## Document-specific features

Another common case in learning to rank is features such as popularity
or recency, tied only to the document. OpenSearch's `function_score`
query has the functionality you need to pull this data out. You already
saw an example when adding features in the last section:

```json
{
    "query": {
        "function_score": {
            "functions": [{
                "field_value_factor": {
                    "field": "vote_average",
                    "missing": 0
                }
            }],
            "query": {
                "match_all": {}
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The score for this query corresponds to the value of the `vote_average`
field.

## Your index may drift

If you have an index that updates regularly, trends that held true
today, may not hold true tomorrow! On an e-commerce store, sandals might
be very popular in the summer, but impossible to find in the winter.
Features that drive purchases for one time period, may not hold true for
another. It's always a good idea to monitor your model's performance
regularly, retrain as needed.
