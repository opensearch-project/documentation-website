# FAQ

This section contains answers to common issues that may trip up users.

## Negative Scores

Lucene does not allow queries to have negative scores. This can be
problematic if you have a raw feature that has a negative value.
Unfortunately there is no easy quick fix for this. If you are working
with such features, you need to make them non-negative *BEFORE* you
train your model. This can be accomplished by creating normalized fields
with values shifted by the mininum value or you can run the score thru a
function that produces a value >= 0.

## I found a bug

If you've been fighting with the plugin it's entirely possible you've
encountered a bug. Open an issue on the Github project and we
will do our best to get it sorted. If you need general support, please
see the following section as we will typically close issues that are only
looking for support.

## I'm still stuck!
