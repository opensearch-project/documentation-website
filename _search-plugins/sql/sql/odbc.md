# ODBC driver

The Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) driver is a read-only ODBC driver for Windows and macOS that lets you connect business intelligence (BI) and data visualization applications like [Microsoft Excel](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql-odbc/blob/main/docs/user/microsoft_excel_support.md) and [Power BI](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql-odbc/blob/main/bi-connectors/PowerBIConnector/README.md) to the SQL plugin.

For information on downloading and using the driver, see [the SQL repository on GitHub](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql-odbc).

## Specifications

The ODBC driver is compatible with ODBC version 3.51.

## Supported OS versions

The following operating systems are supported:

Operating System | Version
:--- | :---
Windows | Windows 10, Windows 11
macOS | Catalina 10.15.4, Mojave 10.14.6, Big Sur 11.6.7, Monterey 12.4


## Concepts

Term | Definition
:--- | :---
**DSN** | A DSN (Data Source Name) is used to store driver information in the system. By storing the information in the system, the information does not need to be specified each time the driver connects.
**.tdc** file | The TDC file contains configuration information that Tableau applies to any connection matching the database vendor name and driver name defined in the file. This configuration allows you to fine-tune parts of your ODBC data connection and turn on/off certain features not supported by the data source.


## Install driver

To install the driver, download the bundled distribution installer from [here](https://opensearch.org/downloads.html) or by build from the source.


### Windows

1. Open the downloaded `OpenSearch SQL ODBC Driver-<version>-Windows.msi` installer.

   The installer is unsigned and shows a security dialog. Choose **More info** and **Run anyway**.

2. Choose **Next** to proceed with the installation.

3. Accept the agreement, and choose **Next**.

4. The installer comes bundled with documentation and useful resource files to connect to various BI tools (for example, a `.tdc` file for Tableau). You can choose to keep or remove these resources. Choose **Next**.

5. Choose **Install** and **Finish**.

The following connection information is set up as part of the default DSN:

```
Host: localhost
Port: 9200
Auth: NONE
```

To customize the DSN, use **ODBC Data Source Administrator** which is pre-installed on Windows 10.


### macOS

Before installing the ODBC Driver on macOS, install the iODBC Driver Manager.

1. Open the downloaded `OpenSearch SQL ODBC Driver-<version>-Darwin.pkg` installer.

   The installer is unsigned and shows a security dialog. Right-click on the installer and choose **Open**.

2. Choose **Continue** several times to proceed with the installation.

3. Choose the **Destination** to install the driver files.

4. The installer comes bundled with documentation and useful resources files to connect to various BI tools (for example, a `.tdc` file for Tableau). You can choose to keep or remove these resources. Choose **Continue**.

5. Choose **Install** and **Close**.

Currently, the DSN is not set up as part of the installation and needs to be configured manually. First, open `iODBC Administrator`:

```
sudo /Applications/iODBC/iODBC\ Administrator64.app/Contents/MacOS/iODBC\ Administrator64
```

This command gives the application permissions to save the driver and DSN configurations.

1. Choose **ODBC Drivers** tab.
2. Choose **Add a Driver** and fill in the following details:
   - **Description of the Driver**: Enter the driver name that you used for the ODBC connection (for example, OpenSearch SQL ODBC Driver).
   - **Driver File Name**: Enter the path to the driver file (default: `<driver-install-dir>/bin/libopensearchsqlodbc.dylib`).
   - **Setup File Name**: Enter the path to the setup file (default: `<driver-install-dir>/bin/libopensearchsqlodbc.dylib`).

3. Choose the user driver.
4. Choose **OK** to save the options.
5. Choose the **User DSN** tab.
6. Select **Add**.
7. Choose the driver that you added above.
8. For **Data Source Name (DSN)**, enter the name of the DSN used to store connection options (for example, OpenSearch SQL ODBC DSN).
9. For **Comment**, add an optional comment.
10. Add key-value pairs by using the `+` button. We recommend the following options for a default local OpenSearch installation:
   - **Host**: `localhost` - OpenSearch server endpoint
   - **Port**: `9200` - The server port
   - **Auth**: `NONE` - The authentication mode
   - **Username**: `(blank)` - The username used for BASIC auth
   - **Password**: `(blank)`- The password used for BASIC auth
   - **ResponseTimeout**: `10` - The number of seconds to wait for a response from the server
   - **UseSSL**: `0` - Do not use SSL for connections

11. Choose **OK** to save the DSN configuration.
12. Choose **OK** to exit the iODBC Administrator.


## Customizing the ODBC driver

The driver is in the form of a library file: `opensearchsqlodbc.dll` for Windows and `libopensearchsqlodbc.dylib` for macOS.

If you're using with ODBC compatible BI tools, refer to your BI tool documentation for configuring a new ODBC driver.
Typically, all that's required is to make the BI tool aware of the location of the driver library file and then use it to set up the database (i.e., OpenSearch) connection.


### Connection strings and other settings

The ODBC driver uses an ODBC connection string.
The connection strings are semicolon-delimited strings that specify the set of options that you can use for a connection.
Typically, a connection string will either:
  - Specify a Data Source Name (DSN) that contains a pre-configured set of options (`DSN=xxx;User=xxx;Password=xxx;`).
  - Or, configure options explicitly using the string (`Host=xxx;Port=xxx;LogLevel=ES_DEBUG;...`).

You can configure the following driver options using a DSN or connection string:

All option names are case-insensitive.

## Connecting to Tableau

Pre-requisites:

- Make sure the DSN is already set up.
- Make sure OpenSearch is running on _host_ and _port_ as configured in DSN.
- Make sure the `.tdc` is copied to `<user_home_directory>/Documents/My Tableau Repository/Datasources` in both macOS and Windows.

1. Start Tableau. Under the **Connect** section, go to **To a Server** and choose **Other Databases (ODBC)**.

2. In the **DSN drop-down**, select the OpenSearch DSN you set up in the previous set of steps. The options you added will be automatically filled in under the **Connection Attributes**.

3. Select **Sign In**. After a few seconds, Tableau connects to your OpenSearch server. Once connected, you will be directed to the **Datasource** window. The **Database** will be already be populated with the name of the OpenSearch cluster.
To list all the indices, click the search icon under **Table**.

4. Start experimenting with data by dragging the table to the connection area. Choose **Update Now** or **Automatically Update** to populate the table data.

See more detailed instructions in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql/blob/main/sql-odbc/docs/user/tableau_support.md).

### Troubleshooting

**Problem**

Unable to connect to server.

**Workaround**

This is most likely due to OpenSearch server not running on **host** and **post** configured in DSN.
Confirm **host** and **post** are correct and OpenSearch server is running with OpenSearch SQL plugin.
Also make sure `.tdc` that was downloaded with the installer is copied correctly to `<user_home_directory>/Documents/My Tableau Repository/Datasources` directory.

## Connecting to Microsoft Power BI
