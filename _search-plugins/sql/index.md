# SQL and PPL

OpenSearch SQL lets you write queries in SQL rather than the [OpenSearch query domain-specific language (DSL)]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/query-dsl/full-text). If you're already familiar with SQL and don't want to learn the query DSL, this feature is a great option.

## Contributing

To get involved and help us improve the SQL plugin, see the [development guide](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql/blob/main/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.rst) for instructions on setting up your development environment and building the project.
