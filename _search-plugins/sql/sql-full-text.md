# Full-text search

Use SQL commands for full-text search. The SQL plugin supports a subset of the full-text queries available in OpenSearch.

To learn about full-text queries in OpenSearch, see [Full-text queries]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/query-dsl/full-text/).

## Match

To search for text in a single field, use `MATCHQUERY` or `MATCH_QUERY` functions.

Pass in your search query and the field name that you want to search against.


```sql
SELECT account_number, address
FROM accounts
WHERE MATCH_QUERY(address, 'Holmes')
```

Alternate syntax:

```sql
SELECT account_number, address
FROM accounts
WHERE address = MATCH_QUERY('Holmes')
```


| account_number | address
:--- | :---
1 | 880 Holmes Lane


## Multi match

To search for text in multiple fields, use `MULTI_MATCH`, `MULTIMATCH`, or `MULTIMATCHQUERY` functions.

For example, search for `Dale` in either the `firstname` or `lastname` fields:


```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname
FROM accounts
WHERE MULTI_MATCH('query'='Dale', 'fields'='*name')
```


| firstname | lastname
:--- | :---
Dale | Adams


## Query string

To split text based on operators, use the `QUERY` function.


```sql
SELECT account_number, address
FROM accounts
WHERE QUERY('address:Lane OR address:Street')
```


| account_number | address
:--- | :---
1 | 880 Holmes Lane
6 | 671 Bristol Street
13 | 789 Madison Street


The `QUERY` function supports logical connectives, wildcard, regex, and proximity search.


## Match phrase

To search for exact phrases, use `MATCHPHRASE`, `MATCH_PHRASE`, or `MATCHPHRASEQUERY` functions.


```sql
SELECT account_number, address
FROM accounts
WHERE MATCH_PHRASE(address, '880 Holmes Lane')
```


| account_number | address
:--- | :---
1 | 880 Holmes Lane


## Score query

To return a relevance score along with every matching document, use `SCORE`, `SCOREQUERY`, or `SCORE_QUERY` functions.

You need to pass in two arguments. The first is the `MATCH_QUERY` expression. The second is an optional floating point number to boost the score (default value is 1.0).


```sql
SELECT account_number, address, _score
FROM accounts
WHERE SCORE(MATCH_QUERY(address, 'Lane'), 0.5) OR
  SCORE(MATCH_QUERY(address, 'Street'), 100)
ORDER BY _score
```


| account_number | address | score
:--- | :--- | :---
1 | 880 Holmes Lane | 0.5
6 | 671 Bristol Street | 100
13 | 789 Madison Street | 100
