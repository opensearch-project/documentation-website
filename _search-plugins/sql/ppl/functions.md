# Commands

`PPL` supports all [`SQL` common]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/sql/functions/) functions, including [relevance search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/sql/full-text/), but also introduces few more functions (called `commands`) which are available in `PPL` only.

## dedup

The `dedup` (data deduplication) command removes duplicate documents defined by a field from the search result.

### Syntax

```sql
dedup [int] <field-list> [keepempty=<bool>] [consecutive=<bool>]
```

Field | Description | Type | Required | Default
:--- | :--- |:--- |:--- |:---
`int` |  Retain the specified number of duplicate events for each combination. The number must be greater than 0. If you do not specify a number, only the first occurring event is kept and all other duplicates are removed from the results. | `string` | No | 1
`keepempty` | If true, keep the document if any field in the field list has a null value or a field missing. | `nested list of objects` | No | False
`consecutive` | If true, remove only consecutive events with duplicate combinations of values. | `Boolean` | No | False
`field-list` | Specify a comma-delimited field list. At least one field is required. | `String` or comma-separated list of strings | Yes | -

**Example 1: Dedup by one field**

To remove duplicate documents with the same gender:

```sql
search source=accounts | dedup gender | fields account_number, gender;
```

| account_number | gender
:--- | :--- |
1 | M
13 | F


**Example 2: Keep two duplicate documents**

To keep two duplicate documents with the same gender:

```sql
search source=accounts | dedup 2 gender | fields account_number, gender;
```

| account_number | gender
:--- | :--- |
1 | M
6 | M
13 | F

**Example 3: Keep or ignore an empty field by default**

To keep two duplicate documents with a `null` field value:

```sql
search source=accounts | dedup email keepempty=true | fields account_number, email;
```

| account_number | email
:--- | :--- |
1 | amberduke@pyrami.com
6 | hattiebond@netagy.com
13 | null
18 | daleadams@boink.com

To remove duplicate documents with the `null` field value:

```sql
search source=accounts | dedup email | fields account_number, email;
```

| account_number | email
:--- | :--- |
1 | amberduke@pyrami.com
6 | hattiebond@netagy.com
18 | daleadams@boink.com

**Example 4: Dedup of consecutive documents**

To remove duplicates of consecutive documents:

```sql
search source=accounts | dedup gender consecutive=true | fields account_number, gender;
```

| account_number | gender
:--- | :--- |
1 | M
13 | F
18 | M

### Limitations

The `dedup` command is not rewritten to OpenSearch DSL, it is only executed on the coordination node.

## eval

The `eval` command evaluates an expression and appends its result to the search result.

### Syntax

```sql
eval <field>=<expression> ["," <field>=<expression> ]...
```

Field | Description | Required
:--- | :--- |:---
`field` | If a field name does not exist, a new field is added. If the field name already exists, it's overwritten. | Yes
`expression` | Specify any supported expression. | Yes

**Example 1: Create a new field**

To create a new `doubleAge` field for each document. `doubleAge` is the result of `age` multiplied by 2:

```sql
search source=accounts | eval doubleAge = age * 2 | fields age, doubleAge;
```

| age | doubleAge
:--- | :--- |
32    | 64
36    | 72
28    | 56
33    | 66

*Example 2*: Overwrite the existing field

To overwrite the `age` field with `age` plus 1:

```sql
search source=accounts | eval age = age + 1 | fields age;
```

| age
:--- |
| 33
| 37
| 29
| 34

**Example 3: Create a new field with a field defined with the `eval` command**

To create a new field `ddAge`. `ddAge` is the result of `doubleAge` multiplied by 2, where `doubleAge` is defined in the `eval` command:

```sql
search source=accounts | eval doubleAge = age * 2, ddAge = doubleAge * 2 | fields age, doubleAge, ddAge;
```

| age | doubleAge | ddAge
:--- | :--- |
| 32    | 64   | 128
| 36    | 72   | 144
| 28    | 56   | 112
| 33    | 66   | 132


### Limitation

The ``eval`` command is not rewritten to OpenSearch DSL, it is only executed on the coordination node.

## fields

Use the `fields` command to keep or remove fields from a search result.

### Syntax

```sql
fields [+|-] <field-list>
```

Field | Description | Required | Default
:--- | :--- |:---|:---
`index` | Plus (+) keeps only fields specified in the field list. Minus (-) removes all fields specified in the field list. | No | +
`field list` | Specify a comma-delimited list of fields. | Yes | No default

**Example 1: Select specified fields from result**

To get `account_number`, `firstname`, and `lastname` fields from a search result:

```sql
search source=accounts | fields account_number, firstname, lastname;
```

| account_number | firstname  | lastname
:--- | :--- |
| 1   | Amber       | Duke
| 6   | Hattie      | Bond
| 13  | Nanette     | Bates
| 18  | Dale        | Adams

**Example 2: Remove specified fields from a search result**

To remove the `account_number` field from the search results:

```sql
search source=accounts | fields account_number, firstname, lastname | fields - account_number;
```

| firstname | lastname
:--- | :--- |
| Amber   | Duke
| Hattie  | Bond
| Nanette | Bates
| Dale    | Adams


## parse

Use the `parse` command to parse a text field using regular expression and append the result to the search result. 

### Syntax

```sql
parse <field> <regular-expression>
```

Field | Description | Required
:--- | :--- |:---
field | A text field. | Yes
regular-expression | The regular expression used to extract new fields from the given test field. If a new field name exists, it will replace the original field. | Yes

The regular expression is used to match the whole text field of each document with Java regex engine. Each named capture group in the expression will become a new ``STRING`` field.

**Example 1: Create new field**

The example shows how to create new field `host` for each document. `host` will be the hostname after `@` in `email` field. Parsing a null field will return an empty string.

```sql
os> source=accounts | parse email '.+@(?<host>.+)' | fields email, host ;
fetched rows / total rows = 4/4
```

| email | host  
:--- | :--- |
| amberduke@pyrami.com  | pyrami.com 
| hattiebond@netagy.com | netagy.com 
| null                  | null          
| daleadams@boink.com   | boink.com  

*Example 2*: Override the existing field

The example shows how to override the existing address field with street number removed.

```sql
os> source=accounts | parse address '\d+ (?<address>.+)' | fields address ;
fetched rows / total rows = 4/4
```

| address
:--- |
| Holmes Lane      
| Bristol Street   
| Madison Street   
| Hutchinson Court

**Example 3: Filter and sort be casted parsed field**

The example shows how to sort street numbers that are higher than 500 in address field.

```sql
os> source=accounts | parse address '(?<streetNumber>\d+) (?<street>.+)' | where cast(streetNumber as int) > 500 | sort num(streetNumber) | fields streetNumber, street ;
fetched rows / total rows = 3/3
```

| streetNumber | street  
:--- | :--- |
| 671 | Bristol Street 
| 789 | Madison Street 
| 880 | Holmes Lane  

### Limitations

A few limitations exist when using the parse command:

- Fields defined by parse cannot be parsed again. For example, `source=accounts | parse address '\d+ (?<street>.+)' | parse street '\w+ (?<road>\w+)' ;` will fail to return any expressions.
- Fields defined by parse cannot be overridden with other commands. For example, when entering `source=accounts | parse address '\d+ (?<street>.+)' | eval street='1' | where street='1' ;` `where` will not match any documents since `street` cannot be overridden.
- The text field used by parse cannot be overridden. For example, when entering `source=accounts | parse address '\d+ (?<street>.+)' | eval address='1' ;` `street` will not be parse since address is overridden. 
- Fields defined by parse cannot be filtered/sorted after using them in the `stats` command. For example, `source=accounts | parse email '.+@(?<host>.+)' | stats avg(age) by host | where host=pyrami.com ;` `where` will not parse the domain listed.

## rename

Use the `rename` command to rename one or more fields in the search result.

### Syntax

```sql
rename <source-field> AS <target-field>["," <source-field> AS <target-field>]...
```

Field | Description | Required
:--- | :--- |:---
`source-field` | The name of the field that you want to rename. | Yes
`target-field` | The name you want to rename to. | Yes

**Example 1: Rename one field**

```sql
search source=accounts | rename account_number as an | fields an;
```

| an
:--- |
| 1
| 6
| 13
| 18

**Example 2: Rename multiple fields**

Rename the `account_number` field as `an` and `employer` as `emp`:

```sql
search source=accounts | rename account_number as an, employer as emp | fields an, emp;
```

| an   | emp
:--- | :--- |
| 1    | Pyrami
| 6    | Netagy
| 13   | Quility
| 18   | null

### Limitations

The `rename` command is not rewritten to OpenSearch DSL, it is only executed on the coordination node.

## sort

## ad

The `ad` command applies the Random Cut Forest (RCF) algorithm in the [ML Commons plugin]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/index/) on the search result returned by a PPL command. Based on the input, the plugin uses two types of RCF algorithms: fixed in time RCF for processing time-series data and batch RCF for processing non-time-series data.

### Syntax: Fixed In Time RCF For Time-series Data Command

```sql
ad <shingle_size> <time_decay> <time_field>
```

Field | Description | Required
:--- | :--- |:---
`shingle_size` | A consecutive sequence of the most recent records. The default value is 8. | No
`time_decay` | Specifies how much of the recent past to consider when computing an anomaly score. The default value is 0.001. | No
`time_field` | Specifies the time filed for RCF to use as time-series data. Must be either a long value, such as the timestamp in miliseconds, or a string value in "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss".| Yes

### Syntax: Batch RCF for Non-time-series Data Command

```sql
ad <shingle_size> <time_decay>
```

Field | Description | Required
:--- | :--- |:---
`shingle_size` | A consecutive sequence of the most recent records. The default value is 8. | No
`time_decay` | Specifies how much of the recent past to consider when computing an anomaly score. The default value is 0.001. | No

**Example 1: Detecting events in New York City from taxi ridership data with time-series data**

The example trains a RCF model and use the model to detect anomalies in the time-series ridership data.

PPL query:

```sql
os> source=nyc_taxi | fields value, timestamp | AD time_field='timestamp' | where value=10844.0
```

value | timestamp | score | anomaly_grade
:--- | :--- |:--- | :---
10844.0 | 1404172800000 | 0.0 | 0.0    

**Example 2: Detecting events in New York City from taxi ridership data with non-time-series data**

PPL query:

```sql
os> source=nyc_taxi | fields value | AD | where value=10844.0
```

value | score | anomalous
:--- | :--- |:--- 
| 10844.0 | 0.0 | false  

## kmeans

The kmeans command applies the ML Commons plugin's kmeans algorithm to the provided PPL command's search results.

### Syntax

```sql
kmeans <cluster-number>
```

For `cluster-number`, enter the number of clusters you want to group your data points into.

**Example: Group Iris data**

The example shows how to classify three Iris species (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor) based on the combination of four features measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals.

PPL query:

```sql
os> source=iris_data | fields sepal_length_in_cm, sepal_width_in_cm, petal_length_in_cm, petal_width_in_cm | kmeans 3
```

sepal_length_in_cm | sepal_width_in_cm | petal_length_in_cm | petal_width_in_cm | ClusterID
:--- | :--- |:--- | :--- | :--- 
| 5.1 | 3.5 | 1.4 | 0.2 | 1   
| 5.6 | 3.0 | 4.1 | 1.3 | 0
| 6.7 | 2.5 | 5.8 | 1.8 | 2
