# Radial search

Radial search enhances the k-NN plugin's capabilities beyond approximate top-`k` searches. With radial search, you can search all points within a vector space that reside within a specified maximum distance or minimum score threshold from a query point. This provides increased flexibility and utility in search operations.

## Parameter type

`max_distance` allows users to specify a physical distance within the vector space, identifying all points that are within this distance from the query point. This approach is particularly useful for applications requiring spatial proximity or absolute distance measurements.

`min_score` enables the specification of a similarity score, facilitating the retrieval of points that meet or exceed this score in relation to the query point. This method is ideal in scenarios where relative similarity, based on a specific metric, is more critical than physical proximity.

Only one query variable, either `k`, `max_distance`, or `min_score`, is required to be specified during radial search. For more information about the vector spaces, see [Spaces](#spaces).

## Supported cases

You can perform radial search with either the Lucene or Faiss engines. The following table summarizes radial search use cases by engine.

| Engine supported  | Filter supported  | Nested field supported | Search type  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Lucene           | true             | false                  | approximate    |
| Faiss            | true             | true                   | approximate    |

## Spaces

A space corresponds to the function used to measure the distance between two points in order to determine the k-nearest neighbors. When using k-NN, a lower score equates to a closer and better result. This is the opposite of how OpenSearch scores results, where a greater score equates to a better result. To convert distances to OpenSearch scores, radial search uses the following formula: 1 / (1 + distance). The k-NN plugin supports the following spaces.
Not every method supports each of these spaces. Be sure to refer to [the method documentation]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/knn/knn-index#method-definitions) to verify that the space you want to use is supported.

The cosine similarity formula does not include the `1 -` prefix. However, because similarity search libraries equate
lower scores with closer results, they return `1 - cosineSimilarity` for the cosine similarity space. This is why `1 -` is
included in the distance function.
{: .note }

With cosine similarity, it is not valid to pass a zero vector (`[0, 0, ...]`) as an input. This is because the magnitude of
such a vector is 0, which raises a `divide by 0` exception in the corresponding formula. Requests
containing a zero vector will be rejected, and a corresponding exception will be thrown.

## Examples

The following examples can help you to get started with radial search.

### Prerequisites

To use a k-NN index with radial search, create a k-NN index by setting `index.knn` to `true`. Specify one or more fields of the `knn_vector` data type, as shown in the following example:

```json
PUT knn-index-test
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "number_of_replicas": 1,
    "index.knn": true
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "my_vector": {
        "type": "knn_vector",
        "dimension": 2,
        "method": {
            "name": "hnsw",
            "space_type": "l2",
            "engine": "faiss",
            "parameters": {
              "ef_construction": 100,
              "m": 16,
              "ef_search": 100
            }
          }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

After you create the index, add some data similar to the following:

```json
PUT _bulk?refresh=true
{"index": {"_index": "knn-index-test", "_id": "1"}}
{"my_vector": [7.0, 8.2], "price": 4.4}
{"index": {"_index": "knn-index-test", "_id": "2"}}
{"my_vector": [7.1, 7.4], "price": 14.2}
{"index": {"_index": "knn-index-test", "_id": "3"}}
{"my_vector": [7.3, 8.3], "price": 19.1}
{"index": {"_index": "knn-index-test", "_id": "4"}}
{"my_vector": [6.5, 8.8], "price": 1.2}
{"index": {"_index": "knn-index-test", "_id": "5"}}
{"my_vector": [5.7, 7.9], "price": 16.5}

```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Example: Radial search with `max_distance`

The following example shows a radial search performed with `max_distance`:

```json
GET knn-index-test/_search
{
    "query": {
        "knn": {
            "my_vector": {
                "vector": [
                    7.1,
                    8.3
                ],
                "max_distance": 2
            }
        }
    }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

All documents that fall within the squared Euclidean distance (`l2^2`) of 2 are returned, as shown in the following response:
