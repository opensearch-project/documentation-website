# User Behavior Insights

**Introduced 2.15**
{: .label .label-purple }

**References UBI Specification 1.3.0**
{: .label .label-purple }

User Behavior Insights (UBI) is a schema for capturing user search behavior. Search behavior consists of the queries that the user submits, the results that are presented to them, and the actions they take on those results. The UBI schema links all user interactions (events) to the search result they were performed on. That is, it not only captures the chronological sequence of events but also captures the causal links between events. Analysis of this behavior is used for improving the quality of search results.

Client applications such as web pages or apps capture user behavior and send UBI data to a UBI endpoint. For web pages, this is typically handled by JavaScript code.

In principle, queries sent to the server and results returned by the server can be sent to the UBI endpoint from the client. But as an optimization, they can instead be sent directly to the UBI endpoint from the server, without incurring a round-trip to the client. That is the function of the UBI plugin and is not a requirement to adopt UBI.

UBI includes the following elements:
* A machine-readable [schema](https://github.com/o19s/ubi) that facilitates interoperability of the UBI specification.
* [ubi.js](https://github.com/opensearch-project/user-behavior-insights/tree/main/ubi-javascript-collector/ubi.js): An (optional) client-side JavaScript library for capturing searches and events.
* An (optional) OpenSearch [plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/user-behavior-insights) that streamlines the recording of query data.

Advanced features in OpenSearch, such as the [Search Relevance Workbench]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-relevance/using-search-relevance-workbench/) and the [Hybrid Search Optimizer]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-relevance/optimize-hybrid-search/), build on the data collected according to the UBI specification.
