# Star-tree index

This is an experimental feature and is not recommended for use in a production environment. For updates on the progress of the feature or if you want to leave feedback, join the discussion on the [OpenSearch forum](https://forum.opensearch.org/).    
{: .warning}

A star-tree index is a multi-field index that improves the performance of aggregations.

OpenSearch will automatically use a star-tree index to optimize aggregations if the queried fields are part of dimension fields and the aggregations are on star-tree metric fields. No changes are required in the query syntax or the request parameters.

## When to use a star-tree index

A star-tree index can be used to perform faster aggregations. Consider the following criteria and features when deciding to use a star-tree index:

- Star-tree indexes natively support multi-field aggregations.
- Star-tree indexes are created in real time as part of the indexing process, so the data in a star-tree will always be up to date.
- A star-tree index consolidates data, increasing index paging efficiency and using less IO for search queries.

## Limitations

Star-tree indexes have the following limitations:

- A star-tree index should only be enabled on indexes whose data is not updated or deleted because updates and deletions are not accounted for in a star-tree index.
- A star-tree index can be used for aggregation queries only if the queried fields are a subset of the star-tree's dimensions and the aggregated fields are a subset of the star-tree's metrics.
- After a star-tree index is enabled, it cannot be disabled. In order to disable a star-tree index, the data in the index must be reindexed without the star-tree mapping. Furthermore, changing a star-tree configuration will also require a reindex operation.
- [Multi-values/array values]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/field-types/supported-field-types/index/#arrays) are not supported.
- Only [limited queries and aggregations](#supported-queries-and-aggregations) are supported. Support for more features will be added in future versions.
- The cardinality of the dimensions should not be very high (as with `_id` fields). Higher cardinality leads to increased storage usage and query latency.

## Star-tree index structure

The following image illustrates a standard star-tree index structure.

<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/star-tree-index.png" alt="A star-tree index containing two dimensions and two metrics" width="700">

Sorted and aggregated star-tree documents are backed by `doc_values` in an index. The columnar data found in `doc_values` is stored using the following properties:

- The values are sorted based on the fields set in the `ordered_dimension` setting. In the preceding image, the dimensions are determined by the `status` setting and then by the `port` for each status.
- For each unique dimension/value combination, the aggregated values for all the metrics, such as `avg(size)` and `count(requests)`, are precomputed during ingestion.

### Leaf nodes

Each node in a star-tree index points to a range of star-tree documents. Nodes can be further split into child nodes based on the [max_leaf_docs configuration]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/field-types/supported-field-types/star-tree/#star-tree-index-configuration-options). The number of documents that a leaf node points to is less than or equal to the value set in `max_leaf_docs`. This ensures that the maximum number of documents that need to traverse nodes to derive an aggregated value is at most the number of `max_leaf_docs`, which provides predictable latency.

### Star nodes

A star node contains the aggregated data of all the other nodes for a particular dimension, acting as a "catch-all" node. When a star node is found in a dimension, that dimension is skipped during aggregation. This groups together all values of that dimension and allows a query to skip non-competitive nodes when fetching the aggregated value of a particular field. 

The star-tree index structure diagram contains the following three examples demonstrating how a query behaves when retrieving aggregations from nodes in the star-tree:

- **Blue**: In a `terms` query that searches for the average request size aggregation, the `port` equals `8443` and the status equals `200`. Because the query contains values in both the `status` and `port` dimensions, the query traverses status node `200` and returns the aggregations from child node `8443`.
- **Green**: In a `term` query that searches for the number of aggregation requests, the `status` equals `200`. Because the query only contains a value from the `status` dimension, the query traverses the `200` node's child star node, which contains the aggregated value of all the `port` child nodes.
- **Red**: In a `term` query that searches for the average request size aggregation, the port equals `5600`. Because the query does not contain a value from the `status` dimension, the query traverses a star node and returns the aggregated result from the `5600` child node.

Support for the `Terms` query will be added in a future version. For more information, see [GitHub issue #15257](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/15257).

## Enabling a star-tree index

To use a star-tree index, modify the following settings:

- Set the feature flag `opensearch.experimental.feature.composite_index.star_tree.enabled` to `true`. For more information about enabling and disabling feature flags, see [Enabling experimental features]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/configuring-opensearch/experimental/).
- Set the `indices.composite_index.star_tree.enabled` setting to `true`. For instructions on how to configure OpenSearch, see [Configuring settings]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/configuring-opensearch/index/#static-settings).
- Set the `index.composite_index` index setting to `true` during index creation.
- Ensure that the `doc_values` parameter is enabled for the `dimensions` and `metrics` fields used in your star-tree mapping.


## Example mapping

In the following example, index mappings define the star-tree configuration. The star-tree index precomputes aggregations in the `logs` index. The aggregations are calculated on the `size` and `latency` fields for all the combinations of values indexed in the `port` and `status` fields:

```json
PUT logs
{
  "settings": {
    "index.number_of_shards": 1,
    "index.number_of_replicas": 0,
    "index.composite_index": true
  },
  "mappings": {
    "composite": {
      "request_aggs": {
        "type": "star_tree",
        "config": {
          "ordered_dimensions": [
            {
              "name": "status"
            },
            {
              "name": "port"
            }
          ],
          "metrics": [
            {
              "name": "size",
              "stats": [
                "sum"
              ]
            },
            {
              "name": "latency",
              "stats": [
                "avg"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    "properties": {
      "status": {
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "port": {
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "size": {
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "latency": {
        "type": "scaled_float",
        "scaling_factor": 10
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Supported queries and aggregations

Star-tree indexes can be used to optimize queries and aggregations. 

### Supported queries

The following queries are supported as of OpenSearch 2.18:

- [Term query](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/query-dsl/term/term/)
- [Match all docs query](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/query-dsl/match-all/)

To use a query with a star-tree index, the query's fields must be present in the `ordered_dimensions` section of the star-tree configuration. Queries must also be paired with a supported aggregation. 

### Supported aggregations
 
The following metric aggregations are supported as of OpenSearch 2.18:
- [Sum](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/aggregations/metric/sum/)
- [Minimum](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/aggregations/metric/minimum/)
- [Maximum](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/aggregations/metric/maximum/)
- [Value count](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/aggregations/metric/value-count/)
- [Average](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/aggregations/metric/average/)

To use aggregations:

- The fields must be present in the `metrics` section of the star-tree configuration.
- The metric aggregation type must be part of the `stats` parameter.

### Aggregation example

The following example gets the sum of all the values in the `size` field for all error logs with `status=500`, using the [example mapping](#example-mapping):

```json
POST /logs/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "status": "500"
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "sum_size": {
      "sum": {
        "field": "size"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Using a star-tree index, the result will be retrieved from a single aggregated document as it traverses the `status=500` node, as opposed to scanning through all of the matching documents. This results in lower query latency.

## Using queries without a star-tree index

Set the `indices.composite_index.star_tree.enabled` setting to `false` to run queries without using a star-tree index.
