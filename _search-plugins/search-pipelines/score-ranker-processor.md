# Score ranker processor
Introduced 2.19
{: .label .label-purple }

The `score-ranker-processor` is a rank-based search phase results processor that runs between the query and fetch phases of search execution. It intercepts the query phase results and then uses the reciprocal rank fusion (RRF) algorithm to combine different query clauses to produce the final ranked list of search results. RRF is a method for combining multiple queries by scoring each document based on the reciprocal of its rank for each query and then adding these scores to create a final, unified ranking.

## Request body fields

The following table lists all available request fields.

Field | Data type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
`combination.technique` | String | The technique used for combining scores. Required. Valid value is `rrf`.
`combination.rank_constant` | Integer | A constant added to each document's rank before calculating the reciprocal score. Must be `1` or greater. A larger rank constant makes the scores more uniform, reducing the influence of top-ranked results. A smaller rank constant creates a greater score difference between ranks, giving more weight to top-ranked items. Optional. Default is `60`.
`combination.parameters.weights` | Array of floating-point values | Specifies the weights to use for each query. Valid values are in the [0.0, 1.0] range and signify decimal percentages. The closer the weight is to 1.0, the more weight is given to a query. The number of values in the `weights` array must equal the number of queries. The sum of the values in the array must equal 1.0. Optional. If not provided, all queries are given equal weight.
## Example

The following example demonstrates using a search pipeline with a `score-ranker-processor`.

### Creating a search pipeline with a score ranker processor

The following request creates a search pipeline containing a `score-ranker-processor` that uses the `rrf` combination technique:

```json
PUT /_search/pipeline/<rrf-pipeline>
{
  "description": "Post processor for hybrid RRF search",
  "phase_results_processors": [
    {
      "score-ranker-processor": {
        "combination": {
          "technique": "rrf"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Tuning the search pipeline using custom parameters

Apply a custom `rank-constant` parameter in the search pipeline created in the previous section. The default value of `rank-constant` is 60. In the following example, `rank-constant` is set to 40:

```json
PUT /_search/pipeline/<rrf-pipeline>
{
  "description": "Post processor for hybrid RRF search",
  "phase_results_processors": [
    {
      "score-ranker-processor": {
        "combination": {
          "technique": "rrf",
          "rank_constant": 40
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Apply custom `weights` to each subquery when combing search results using the `rrf` technique. By default, each subquery is given an equal weight of 1. In the following example, subquery 1 has a weight of 0.7, and subquery 2 has a weight of 0.3:

```json
PUT /_search/pipeline/<rrf-pipeline>
{
  "description": "Post processor for hybrid RRF search",
  "phase_results_processors": [
    {   
     "score-ranker-processor": {
       "combination": {
         "technique": "rrf",
         "rank_constant": 40,
         "parameters": {
            "weights":[
              0.7,
              0.3
            ]
         }
       }
     }
    }
  ]
}
```
