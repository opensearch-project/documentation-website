# Agentic context processor
**Introduced 3.3**
{: .label .label-purple }

The `agentic_context` search response processor adds agent execution context information to search response extensions. This processor works in conjunction with the [agentic query translator]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-pipelines/agentic-query-translator-processor/) to expose the agent's query translation process and maintain conversation continuity:

1. The processor retrieves agent context information from the pipeline processing context.
2. Based on the processor configuration, it selectively includes the agent steps summary and the query domain-specific language (DSL) query in the response.
3. The memory ID is always included, when available, for conversation continuity.
4. The context information is added to the search response extensions.
5. Type validation ensures that all context attributes are strings.

This processor works with both conversational and flow agents, but the available context information differs by agent type. Flow agents provide `dsl_query` (the generated DSL) only, while conversational agents provide `dsl_query`, `memory_id`, and `agent_steps_summary`. For more information, see [Agent types]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/vector-search/ai-search/agentic-search/index/#agent-types).

## Request body fields

The following table lists all available request fields.

Field | Data type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
`agent_steps_summary` | Boolean | Whether to include the agent's execution step summary in the response. Available for conversational agents only. Optional. Default is `false`. 
`dsl_query` | Boolean | Whether to include the generated DSL query in the response. Available for both conversational and flow agents. Optional. Default is `false`. 

## Response fields

When enabled, the processor adds the following fields to the search response extensions.

Field | Description
:--- | :---
`agent_steps_summary` | A summary of the steps that the agent took to translate the natural language query (included when `agent_steps_summary` is `true`). Available for conversational agents only.
`memory_id` | The conversation memory ID for maintaining context across queries. Available for conversational agents only. Only provide this in the `agentic` query if you want to continue the previous conversation.
`dsl_query` | The generated DSL query that was executed (included when `dsl_query` is `true`). Available for both conversational and flow agents.

## Example

The following example request creates a search pipeline with an `agentic_context` response processor:

```json
PUT /_search/pipeline/agentic_pipeline
{
  "request_processors": [
    {
      "agentic_query_translator": {
        "agent_id": "your-agent-id"
      }
    }
  ],
  "response_processors": [
    {
      "agentic_context": {
        "agent_steps_summary": true,
        "dsl_query": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Perform a search using the configured pipeline:

```json
POST /your-index/_search?search_pipeline=agentic_search_pipeline
{
    "query": {
        "agentic": {
            "query_text": "Show me shoes in white color",
            "memory_id": "your memory id"
        }
    }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains the steps taken by the agent to translate the query, the memory ID, and the rewritten DSL query:

```json
{
  "took": 15,
  "hits": {
    "_shards": {...},
    "hits": [...]
  },
   "ext": {
        "agent_steps_summary": "I have these tools available: [ListIndexTool, IndexMappingTool, query_planner_tool]\\nFirst I used: ListIndexTool — input: \"\"; context gained: \"Discovered products-index which seems relevant for products and pricing context\"\\nSecond I used: IndexMappingTool — input: \"products-index\"; context gained: \"Confirmed presence of category and price fields in products-index\"\\nThird I used: query_planner_tool — qpt.question: \"Show me shoes that cost exactly 100 dollars.\"; index_name_provided: \"products-index\"\\nValidation: qpt output is valid and accurately reflects the request for shoes priced at 100 dollars.",
        "memory_id": "WVhHiJkBnqovov2plcDH",
        "dsl_query": "{\"query\":{\"bool\":{\"filter\":[{\"term\":{\"category\":\"shoes\"}},{\"term\":{\"price\":100.0}}]}}}"
    }
}
```
