# Customizing search results

OpenSearch provides fundamental search capabilities and options that form the foundation of most search applications. These features work with all search types including keyword, vector, and AI search.

## Pagination

Control how search results are accessed across large result sets:

- [Paginate results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/searching-data/paginate/): Rather than a single, long list, separate search results into pages.
- [Point in Time]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/searching-data/point-in-time/): Run different queries against a dataset that is fixed in time.

## Sort and filter

Apply the most common result refinements:

- [Sort results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/searching-data/sort/): Allow sorting of results by different criteria.
- [Filter results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/filter-search/): Filter search results based on specific criteria.

## Result processing

Control what data is returned and how it's organized:

- [Collapse results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/collapse-search/): Collapse search results to show only unique values for a specified field.
- [Retrieve specific fields]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/searching-data/retrieve-specific-fields/): Retrieve only the specific fields you need.
- [Retrieve inner hits]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/searching-data/inner-hits/): Retrieve underlying hits in nested and parent-join objects.

## Result formatting

Customize how search results are visually presented:

- [Highlight query matches]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/searching-data/highlight/): Highlight the search term in the results.

## Query enhancement

Enhance user queries in real-time to improve search accuracy and user experience:

- [Autocomplete functionality]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/searching-data/autocomplete/): Suggest phrases as the user types.
- [Did-you-mean functionality]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/searching-data/did-you-mean/): Check spelling of phrases as the user types.
