# Searching data

What users expect from search engines has evolved over the years. Just returning relevant results quickly is no longer enough for most users. Now users seek methods that allow them to get even more relevant results, to sort and organize results, and to highlight their queries. OpenSearch includes many features, described in the following table, that enhance the search experience.

Feature | Description
:--- | :---
[Autocomplete functionality]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/search/autocomplete/) | Suggest phrases as the user types.
[Did-you-mean functionality]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/search/did-you-mean/) | Check spelling of phrases as the user types.
[Paginate results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/search/paginate/) | Rather than a single, long list, separate search results into pages.
[Sort results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/search/sort/) | Allow sorting of results by different criteria.
[Highlight query matches]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/search/highlight/) | Highlight the search term in the results.
