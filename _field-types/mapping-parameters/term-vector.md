# Term vector

The `term_vector` mapping parameter controls whether term-level information is stored for individual text fields during indexing. This information includes details such as term frequency, position, and character offsets, which can be used for advanced features like custom scoring and highlighting.

By default, `term_vector` is disabled. When enabled, term vectors are stored and can be retrieved using the `_termvectors` API.

Enabling `term_vector` increases index size. Only use it when you need detailed term-level data.
{: .important}

## Configuration options

The `term_vector` parameter supports the following valid values:

- `no` (default): Term vectors are not stored.
- `yes`: Store term frequencies (the number of times a term appears in the specific document) and basic positions.
- `with_positions`: Store term positions. The order in which the term appears in the field.
- `with_offsets`: Store character offsets. The exact starting and ending character positions of the term within the field text.
- `with_positions_offsets`: Store both positions and offsets.
- `with_positions_payloads`: Store term positions along with payloads, which are optional pieces of custom metadata (such as tags or numeric values) that can be attached to individual terms during indexing. Payloads are used in advanced scenarios like custom scoring or tagging but require special analyzers in order to be set up.
- `with_positions_offsets_payloads`: Store all term vector data.

## Enabling term_vector on a field

The following request creates an index named `articles` with the `content` field configured to store term vectors, including positions and offsets:

```json
PUT /articles
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "content": {
        "type": "text",
        "term_vector": "with_positions_offsets"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}


Index a sample document:

```json
PUT /articles/_doc/1
{
  "content": "OpenSearch is an open-source search and analytics suite."
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}


Retrieve term-level statistics using the `_termvectors` API:

```json
POST /articles/_termvectors/1
{
  "fields": ["content"],
  "term_statistics": true,
  "positions": true,
  "offsets": true
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The following response includes detailed term-level statistics for the `content` field in document ID `1`, such as term frequency, document frequency, token positions, and character offsets:

## Highlighting with term vectors

Use the following command to search for the term "analytics" and [highlight]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/searching-data/highlight/) it using the field's stored term vectors:

```json
POST /articles/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "content": "analytics"
    }
  },
  "highlight": {
    "fields": {
      "content": {
        "type": "fvh"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The following response shows a matched document in which the term "analytics" was found in the `content` field. The `highlight` section includes the matched term wrapped in `<em>` tags, using the field's stored term vectors for efficient and accurate highlighting:

```json
{
  ...
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 1,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 0.2876821,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "articles",
        "_id": "1",
        "_score": 0.2876821,
        "_source": {
          "content": "OpenSearch is an open-source search and analytics suite."
        },
        "highlight": {
          "content": [
            "OpenSearch is an open-source search and <em>analytics</em> suite."
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
