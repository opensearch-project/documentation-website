# Semantic field type
**Introduced 3.1**
{: .label .label-purple }

The `semantic` field type is a high-level abstraction that simplifies neural search setup in OpenSearch. It can wrap a variety of field types, including all string and binary fields. The `semantic` field type automatically enables semantic indexing and querying based on the configured machine learning (ML) model.

**PREREQUISITE**<br>
Before using the `semantic` field type, you must configure either a local ML model hosted on your OpenSearch cluster or an externally hosted model connected to your OpenSearch cluster. For more information about local models, see [Using ML models within OpenSearch]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/using-ml-models/). For more information about externally hosted models, see [Connecting to externally hosted models]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/remote-models/index/).

## Example: Dense embedding model

Once you configure a model, you can use it to create an index with a `semantic` field. This example assumes that you have configured a dense embedding model with the ID `n17yX5cBsaYnPfyOzmQU` in your cluster:

```json
PUT /my-nlp-index
{
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "knn": true
    }
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "passage": {
        "type": "semantic",
        "model_id": "n17yX5cBsaYnPfyOzmQU"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

After creating the index, you can retrieve its mapping to verify that a `passage_semantic_info` field was automatically created. The `passage_semantic_info` field contains a `knn_vector` subfield for storing the dense embedding and additional metadata fields for capturing information such as the model ID, model name, and model type:

```json
GET /my-nlp-index/_mapping
{
  "my-nlp-index": {
    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "passage": {
          "type": "semantic",
          "model_id": "n17yX5cBsaYnPfyOzmQU",
          "raw_field_type": "text"
        },
        "passage_semantic_info": {
          "properties": {
            "embedding": {
              "type": "knn_vector",
              "dimension": 384,
              "method": {
                "engine": "faiss",
                "space_type": "l2",
                "name": "hnsw",
                "parameters": {}
              }
            },
            "model": {
              "properties": {
                "id": {
                  "type": "text",
                  "index": false
                },
                "name": {
                  "type": "text",
                  "index": false
                },
                "type": {
                  "type": "text",
                  "index": false
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The `dimension` and `space_type` of the `knn_vector` field are determined by the ML model configuration. For [pretrained dense models](ml-commons-plugin/pretrained-models/#sentence-transformers), this information is included in the default model configuration. For externally hosted dense embedding models, you must explicitly define the `dimension` and `space_type` in the model configuration before using the model with a `semantic` field.

The autogenerated `knn_vector` subfield supports additional settings that are not currently configurable in the `semantic` field. For more information, see [Limitations](#limitations).

## Example: Sparse encoding model

Once you configure a model, you can use it to create an index with a `semantic` field. This example assumes that you have configured a sparse encoding model with the ID `n17yX5cBsaYnPfyOzmQU` in your cluster:

```json
PUT /my-nlp-index
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "passage": {
        "type": "semantic",
        "model_id": "nF7yX5cBsaYnPfyOq2SG"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

After creating the index, you can retrieve its mapping to verify that a `rank_features` field was automatically created:

```json
GET /my-nlp-index/_mapping
{
  "my-nlp-index": {
    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "passage": {
          "type": "semantic",
          "model_id": "nF7yX5cBsaYnPfyOq2SG",
          "raw_field_type": "text"
        },
        "passage_semantic_info": {
          "properties": {
            "embedding": {
              "type": "rank_features"
            },
            "model": {
              "properties": {
                "id": {
                  "type": "text",
                  "index": false
                },
                "name": {
                  "type": "text",
                  "index": false
                },
                "type": {
                  "type": "text",
                  "index": false
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Parameters

The `semantic` field type supports the following parameters:

| Parameter | Data type | Required/Optional | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| `type` | String | Required | Must be set to `semantic`. |
| `raw_field_type` | String | Optional | The underlying field type wrapped by the `semantic` field. The raw input is stored as this type at the path of the semantic field, allowing it to behave like a standard field of that type. Valid values are `text`, `keyword`, `match_only_text`, `wildcard`, `token_count`, and `binary`. Default is `text`. You can use any parameters supported by the underlying field type; those parameters function as expected. |
| `model_id` | String | Required | The ID of the ML model used to generate embeddings from field values during indexing and from query input during search. |
| `search_model_id` | String | Optional | The ID of the ML model used specifically for query-time embedding generation. If not specified, the `model_id` is used. Cannot be specified together with `semantic_field_search_analyzer`. |
| `semantic_info_field_name` | String | Optional | A custom name for the internal metadata field that stores the embedding and model information. By default, this field name is derived by appending `_semantic_info` to the semantic field name. |
| `chunking` | Boolean | Optional | Enables fixed-length token chunking during ingestion. When enabled, the input is split into chunks using a default configuration. See [Text chunking](#text-chunking).|
| `semantic_field_search_analyzer` | String | Optional | Specifies an analyzer for tokenizing the query input when using a sparse model. Valid values are `standard`, `bert-uncased`, and `mbert-uncased`. Cannot be used together with `search_model_id`. For more information, see [Analyzers]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/analyzers/supported-analyzers/). |


## Text chunking

By default, text chunking is disabled for `semantic` fields. This is because enabling chunking requires storing each chunk's embedding in a nested object, which can increase search latency. Searching nested objects requires joining child documents to their parent, along with additional scoring and aggregation logic. The more matching child documents there are, the higher the potential latency.

If you're working with long-form text and want to improve search relevance, you can enable chunking by setting the `chunking` parameter for field when creating an index:

```json
PUT /my-nlp-index
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "passage": {
        "type": "semantic",
        "model_id": "nF7yX5cBsaYnPfyOq2SG",
        "chunking": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Chunking is performed using the [fixed token length algorithm]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ingest-pipelines/processors/text-chunking/#the-fixed-token-length-algorithm). 

### Limitations

Note the following limitations of the `semantic` field:

- When using a `semantic` field with a dense model, the automatically generated `knn_vector` subfield takes the `dimension` and `space_type` values from the model configuration, so you must ensure that this information is defined before using the model. Other `knn_vector` parameters use default values and cannot be customized.

- Text chunking uses a [fixed token length algorithm]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ingest-pipelines/processors/text-chunking/#the-fixed-token-length-algorithm) with default settings. You cannot modify the chunking algorithm.

- For sparse models, OpenSearch applies a default prune ratio of `0.1` when generating sparse embeddings. This value is not configurable. Querying a semantic field with a sparse model does not support the [`neural_sparse_two_phase_processor`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-pipelines/neural-sparse-query-two-phase-processor/), which is used to optimize search latency.

- Querying a semantic field from a remote cluster is not supported.
