# Upgrading OpenSearch

The process of upgrading your OpenSearch version varies depending on your current version of OpenSearch, installation type, tolerance for downtime, and cost-sensitivity. For migrating to OpenSearch, we provide a [Migration Assistant]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/migration-assistant/).

Two upgrade approaches exists:

- Perform a [restart upgrade or a rolling upgrade]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/upgrade-to/snapshot-migrate/) on your existing nodes. A restart upgrade involves upgrading the entire cluster and restarting it, whereas a rolling upgrade requires upgrading and restarting nodes in the cluster one by one.
- Replace existing OpenSearch nodes with new OpenSearch nodes. Node replacement is most popular when upgrading [Docker clusters]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/upgrade-to/docker-upgrade-to/).

Regardless of your approach, to safeguard against data loss, we recommend that you take a [snapshot]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/snapshots/snapshot-restore) of all indexes prior to any migration.

If your existing clients include a version check, such as recent versions of Logstash OSS and Filebeat OSS, [check compatibility]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/tools/index/#compatibility-matrices) before upgrading.

For more information about OpenSearch migration tools, see [OpenSearch upgrade, migration, and comparison tools]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/tools/index/#opensearch-upgrade-migration-and-comparison-tools).
