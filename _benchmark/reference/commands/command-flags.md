# Command flags
OpenSearch Benchmark uses command line flags to change Benchmark's behavior. Not all flags can be used with each command. To find out which flags are supported by a specific command, enter `opensearch-benchmark <command> --h`.

All command flags are added to a command using the following syntax:

```bash
opensearch-benchmark <command> --<command-flag>
```

Flags that accept comma-separated values, such `--telemetry`, can also accept a JSON array. This can be defined by passing a file path ending in `.json` or inline as a JSON string.

- Comma-seperated values: `opensearch-benchmark ... --test-procedure="ingest-only,search-aggregations"`
- JSON file: `opensearch-benchmark ... --workload-params="params.json"`
- JSON inline string: `opensearch-benchmark  ... --telemetry='["node-stats", "recovery-stats"]'`

<!-- vale off -->
## workload-path
<!-- vale on -->

This can be either a directory that contains a `workload.json` file or a `.json` file with an arbitrary name that contains a workload specification. `--workload-path` and `--workload-repository` as well as `--workload` are mutually exclusive.

<!-- vale off -->
## workload-repositor

## workload-revision
<!-- vale on -->

Defines a specific revision from the workload source tree that OpenSearch Benchmark should use. 

<!-- vale off -->
## workload
<!-- vale on -->

Defines which variables to inject into the workload. Variables injected must be available in the workload. To see which parameters are valid in the official workloads, select the workload from [the workloads repository](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-benchmark-workloads).

<!-- vale off -->
## test-procedure
<!-- vale on -->

Defines the test procedures to use with each workload. You can find a list of test procedures that the workload supports by specifying the workload in the `info` command, for example, `opensearch-benchmark info --workload=<workload_name>`. To look up information on a specific test procedure, use the command `opensearch-benchmark info --workload=<workload_name> --test-procedure=<test-procedure>`.

<!-- vale off -->
## test-execution-id
<!-- vale on -->

Defines a unique ID for the test run.

<!-- vale off -->
## include-tasks
<!-- vale on -->

Defines a comma-separated list of test procedure tasks to run. By default, all tasks listed in a test procedure array are run.

Tests are executed in the order they are defined in `test-procedure`---not in the order they are defined in the command. 

All task filters are case sensitive.

<!-- vale off -->
## exclude-tasks
<!-- vale on -->

Defines a comma-separated list of test procedure tasks not to run.

The name of the CPU architecture for which an artifact should be downloaded. 

<!-- vale off -->
## revision
<!-- vale on -->

Defines the current source code revision to use for running a benchmark test. Default is `current`.

This command flag can use the following options:

   - `current`: Uses the source tree's current revision based on your OpenSearch distribution. 
   - `latest`: Fetches the latest revision from the main branch of the source tree. 

You can also use a timestamp or commit ID from the source tree. When using a timestamp, specify `@ts`, where "ts" is a valid ISO 8601 timestamp, for example, `@2013-07-27T10:37:00Z`. 

<!-- vale off -->
## opensearch-plugins

Enables setting parameters for telemetry devices. Accepts a list of comma-separated key-value pairs, each of which are delimited by a colon or a JSON file name. 

<!-- vale off -->
## on-error
<!-- vale on -->

Controls how OpenSearch Benchmark responds to errors. Default is `continue`. 

You can use the following options with this command flag:

- `continue`: Continues to run the test despite the error.
- `abort`: Aborts the test when an error occurs.

<!-- vale off -->
## preserve-install
<!-- vale on -->

Keeps the Benchmark candidate and its index. Default is `false`.

<!-- vale off -->

<!-- vale on -->

Specifies a comma-separated list of latency percentiles to report after the workload runs. Accepts `ints` or `floats` with values between `0` and `100` inclusive. Does not accept `min`, `median`, `mean`, or `max`. Default is `50,90,99,99.9,99.99,100`. 

<!-- vale off -->
## throughput-percentiles
<!-- vale on -->

Specifies a list of throughput percentiles to report after the workload runs, in addition to min/median/mean/max which is always displayed. Like `--latency-percentiles`, the setting accepts `ints` or `floats` with values between `0` and `100` inclusive. Does not accept `min`, `median`, `mean`, or `max`. Default is `None`. 

<!-- vale off -->
## randomization-enabled
<!-- vale on -->

Enables randomization of values in range queries, where the values are drawn from standard value functions registered with `register_standard_value_source` in the workload's `workload.py` file. 

A standard value function is a no-argument function that generates a random pair of values for a certain field, in a dict with keys `"gte"`, `"lte"`, and optionally `"format"`. 

If this argument is `True` but a search operation does not have a registered standard value function, OpenSearch Benchmark raises a `SystemSetupError`. 

Default is `False`. 

<!-- vale off -->
## randomization-repeat-frequency
<!-- vale on -->

Sets what fraction of randomized query values can be repeated. Takes values between `0.0` and `1.0`. Default is `0.3`. This setting does not work when `--randomization-enabled` is not used. 

<!-- vale off -->
## randomization-n
<!-- vale on -->

Sets how many distinct repeatable pair values are generated for each operation when randomization is used. Default is `5000`. This setting does not work when `--randomization-enabled` is not used.
