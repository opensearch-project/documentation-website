# OpenSearch Benchmark

OpenSearch Benchmark is a macrobenchmark utility provided by the [OpenSearch Project](https://github.com/opensearch-project). You can use OpenSearch Benchmark to gather performance metrics from an OpenSearch cluster for a variety of purposes, including:

- Tracking the overall performance of an OpenSearch cluster.
- Informing decisions about when to upgrade your cluster to a new version.
- Determining how changes to your workflow&#8212;such as modifying mappings or queries&#8212;might impact your cluster.

OpenSearch Benchmark can be installed directly on a compatible host running Linux and macOS. You can also run OpenSearch Benchmark in a Docker container. See [Installing OpenSearch Benchmark]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/benchmark/installing-benchmark/) for more information.
