# OpenSearch Benchmark

This page reflects the updated terminology in OpenSearch Benchmark `2.X`. `1.15` is the last supported version in the `1.X` series. For more information about what's changed, see the [version history page]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/benchmark/version-history/). For migration assistance, see the [migration assistance page]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/benchmark/migration-assistance/).
{: .important }

OpenSearch Benchmark is a macrobenchmark utility provided by the [OpenSearch Project](https://github.com/opensearch-project). You can use OpenSearch Benchmark to gather performance metrics from an OpenSearch cluster for a variety of purposes, including:

- Tracking the overall performance of an OpenSearch cluster.
- Informing decisions about when to upgrade your cluster to a new version.
- Determining how changes to your workflow---such as modifying mappings or queries---might impact your cluster.
