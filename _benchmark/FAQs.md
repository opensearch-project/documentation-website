# FAQs

This is intended to be a compendium of frequently-asked questions.  There are only a few currently, but additional ones will be included as the documentation is enhanced.


## How can I get more information about an error that I encountered?

You can take a look at the OSB log files, towards the end, where messages for the latest run will appear.

You also have the following options:
- [Post a question in the OpenSearch Benchmark Slack channel](https://opensearch.slack.com/archives/C082PLA3VPW).
- [Attend the Community Meeting, Office Hours, and Issue Triage](https://www.meetup.com/opensearch/events/309982456/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events).


## Where are the OSB log files located?

By default, they are in the user's home directory, under `$HOME/.osb/osb.log`.


## I'm looking for the latest updates to OSB.  Where can I find the latest incremental build of OSB?

Incremental OSB builds are generated as Docker images when any new changes are merged to the codebase.  They are available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/opensearchstaging/opensearch-benchmark/tags).
