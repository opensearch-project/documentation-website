# FAQs

This section provides answers to frequently asked questions.


## How can I get more information about an error that I encountered?

Check the end of the OSB log files to view messages from the latest run.

You also have the following options:
- [Post a question in the OpenSearch Benchmark Slack channel](https://opensearch.slack.com/archives/C082PLA3VPW).
- [Attend the community meeting, office hours, or issue triage session](https://www.meetup.com/opensearch/events/309982456/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events).


## Where are the OSB log files located?

By default, they are in the user's home directory, under `$HOME/.osb/osb.log`.


## I'm looking for the latest updates to OSB.  Where can I find the latest incremental build of OSB?

Incremental OSB builds are generated as Docker images when any new changes are merged to the codebase.  They are available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/opensearchstaging/opensearch-benchmark/tags).
