# Vector search

The vector search workload benchmarks OpenSearch's vector engine capabilities for both indexing and search operations. It tests various vector search algorithms, quantization methods, and index configurations to measure performance metrics like throughput, latency, and recall accuracy. The workload supports different datasets and can evaluate both trained and untrained vector search methods.

This workload currently supports datasets in either the `HDF5` or `BIG-ANN` formats. To download the datasets, use [this link](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/).

## Test procedures

The vector search workload supports the following test procedures.

### No-train test procedure

The no-train test procedure tests vector search indexes that require no training. You can define the underlying configuration of the vector search algorithm (such as specifying a specific engine or space type) as method definitions. 

### No-train test (index only) procedure

The no-train test (index only) procedure is used to index vector search indexes that require no training. This can be particularly useful when you want to benchmark only the indexing operation.

### No-train test (Amazon OpenSearch Serverless)

The no-train test procedure for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless is used specifically for OpenSearch Serverless vector search collections. This procedure doesn't include operations like **refresh** and **warmup** because they aren't supported by vector search collections.

### Force merge index procedure

The force merge index procedure optimizes vector search indexes by performing force merge operations up to a given maximum number of segments. For large datasets, force merging is a costly operation. Therefore, we recommend using a separate procedure to occasionally trigger force merge operations based on user requirements.

### Train test procedure

The train test procedure benchmarks approximate k-NN search algorithms that require a training step. For example, the Faiss Inverted File Indexing (IVF) technique requires a training step in order to retrieve cluster vectors. After the step is performed, the benchmark can search a smaller number of cluster centroids instead of the entire dataset.

### Search procedure

The search procedure benchmarks previously indexed vector search indexes. This can be useful when you want to benchmark large vector search indexes without reindexing each time because load time can be substantial for large datasets. This procedure includes warmup operations intended to avoid cold start problems during vector search.

## Custom runners

Only one custom runner, `warmup-knn-indices`, is supported by the vector search workload. This runner will warm up k-NN indexes and retry the warmup until it succeeds.

## Running the workload

To run the vector search workload, use the following command:

```bash
export ENDPOINT=<cluster-endpoint>
export PARAMS_FILE=<params-file-path>

opensearch-benchmark execute-test \
    --target-hosts $ENDPOINT \
    --workload vectorsearch \
    --workload-params ${PARAMS_FILE} \
    --pipeline benchmark-only \
    --kill-running-processes
```
{% include copy.html %}

## Sample results

When using the vector search workload, you can expect results similar to the following.

### Train test procedure

### Faiss results

The following sample outputs were generated using the Faiss IVF benchmarking procedure. For brevity, the test used 100 search queries instead of the 10,000 specified in the parameter files. All other parameters remain the same as those in the `params/train` folder. The first run demonstrates results without quantization, the second run demonstrates scalar quantization, and the third run demonstrates product quantization. Note that quantization may cause search recall to drop.

#### Faiss IVF with no quantization/flat encoding
