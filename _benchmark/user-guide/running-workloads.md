# Running a workload

Once you have a complete understanding of the various components of an OpenSearch Benchmark [workload]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/benchmark/user-guide/understanding-workloads/anatomy-of-a-workload/), you can run your first workload. 

## Step 1: Find the workload name

To learn more about the standard workloads included with OpenSearch Benchmark, use the following command:

```
opensearch-benchmark list workloads 
```
{% include copy.html %}

A list of all workloads supported by OpenSearch Benchmark appears. Review the list and select the workload that's most similar to your cluster's use case.

## Step 2: Running the test

After you've selected the workload, you can invoke the workload using the `opensearch-benchmark execute-test` command. Replace  `--target-host` with the `host:port` pairs for your cluster and `--client-options` with any authorization options required to access the cluster. The following example runs the `nyc_taxis` workload on a localhost for testing purposes. 

If you want to run a test on an external cluster, see [Running the workload on your own cluster](#running-a-workload-on-an-external-cluster).

```bash
opensearch-benchmark execute-test --pipeline=benchmark-only --workload=nyc_taxis --target-host=https://localhost:9200 --client-options=basic_auth_user:admin,basic_auth_password:admin,verify_certs:false
```
{% include copy.html %}


Results from the test appear in the directory set by the `--output-path` option in the `execute-test` command.

### Test mode

If you want to run the test in test mode to make sure that your workload operates as intended, add the `--test-mode` option to the `execute-test` command. Test mode ingests only the first 1,000 documents from each index provided and runs query operations against them.

## Step 3: Validate the test

After running an OpenSearch Benchmark test, take the following steps to verify that it has run properly:

1. Note the number of documents in the OpenSearch or OpenSearch Dashboards index that you plan to run the benchmark against.
2. In the results returned by OpenSearch Benchmark, compare the `workload.json` file for your specific workload and verify that the document count matches the number of documents. For example, based on the [nyc_taxis](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-benchmark-workloads/blob/main/nyc_taxis/workload.json#L20) `workload.json` file, you should expect to see `165346692` documents in your cluster.

## Expected results

OSB returns the following response once the benchmark completes:

## Running a workload on an external cluster

Now that you're familiar with running OpenSearch Benchmark on a local cluster, you can run it on your external cluster, as described in the following steps:

1. Replace `https://localhost:9200` with your target cluster endpoint. This could be a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), such as `https://search.mydomain.com`, or a `HOST:PORT` specification.
2. If the cluster is configured with basic authentication, replace the username and password in the command line with the appropriate credentials.
3. Remove the `verify_certs:false` directive if you are not specifying `localhost` as your target cluster. This directive is necessary solely for clusters without SSL certificates.
4. If you are using a `HOST:PORT`specification and plan to use SSL or TLS, either specify `https://` or add the `use_ssl:true` directive to the `--client-options` string option.
5. Remove the `--test-mode` flag to run the full workload rather than an abbreviated test.

You can copy the following command template to use it in your own terminal:

```bash
opensearch-benchmark execute-test --pipeline=benchmark-only --workload=nyc_taxis --target-host=<OpenSearch Cluster Endpoint> --client-options=basic_auth_user:admin,basic_auth_password:admin
```
