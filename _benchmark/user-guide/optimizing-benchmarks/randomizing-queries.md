# Randomizing queries

By default, OpenSearch Benchmark runs identical queries for multiple benchmark iterations. However, running the same queries repeatedly isn't ideal in every test scenario. For example, simulating real-world caching with many iterations of the same query results in one cache miss followed by many hits. OpenSearch Benchmark lets you randomize queries in a configurable way. 

For example, changing `"gte"` and `"lt"` in the following `nyc_taxis` operation creates distinct queries, resulting in unique cache entries:

```json
{
    "name": "range",
    "operation-type": "search",
    "body": {
    "query": {
        "range": {
        "total_amount": {
            "gte": 5,
            "lte": 15
        }
        }
    }
    }
}
```

You can't completely randomize the values because the cache would not get any hits. To get cache hits, the cache must sometimes encounter the same values. To account for the same values while randomizing, OpenSearch Benchmark generates a number $$N$$ of value pairs for each randomized operation at the beginning of the benchmark. OpenSearch Benchmark stores these values in a saved list where each pair is assigned an index from $$1$$ to $$N$$.

Every time OpenSearch sends a query, OpenSearch Benchmark decides whether to use a pair of values from this saved list in the query. It does this a configurable fraction of the time, called _repeat frequency_ (`rf`). If OpenSearch has encountered the value pair before, this might cause a cache hit. For example, if `rf` = 0.7, the cache hit ratio could be up to 70%. This ratio could cause a hit, depending on the benchmark's duration and cache size. 

OpenSearch Benchmark selects saved value pairs using the Zipf probability distribution, where the probability of selecting pair $$i$$ is proportional to $$1 \over i^\alpha$$. In this formula, $$i$$ represents the index of the saved value pair, and $$\alpha$$ controls how concentrated the distribution is. This distribution reflects usage patterns observed in real caches. Pairs with lower $$i$$ values (closer to $$1$$) are selected more frequently, while pairs with higher $$i$$ values (closer to $$N$$) are selected less often.

The other $$1 -$$ `rf` fraction of the time, a new random pair of values is generated. Because OpenSearch Benchmark has not encountered these value pairs before, the pairs should miss the cache.

## Usage

To use this feature in a workload, you must make some changes to `workload.py` and supply some CLI flags when running OpenSearch Benchmark.

### Modifying `workload.py`

Specify how to generate the saved value pairs for each operation by registering a "standard value source" for that operation. This Python function accepts no arguments and returns a dictionary. The keys mirror those in the input query but are randomized. Finally, change the `register()` method so that it registers this function with the operation name and field name, which are randomized.

For example, a standard value source used to randomize the `"total_amount"` field in the preceding `"range"` operation might appear similar to the following function: 

```py
def random_money_values(max_value):
    gte_cents = random.randrange(0, max_value*100)
    lte_cents = random.randrange(gte_cents, max_value*100)
    return {
        "gte":gte_cents/100,
        "lte":lte_cents/100
    }

def range_query_standard_value_source():
    return random_money_values(120.00)
```

Similarly, you can randomize the registration behavior using the following function:

```py
def register(registry):
    registry.register_standard_value_source("range", "total_amount", range_query_standard_value_source)
```

This function may already contain code. Retain it if so. If `workload.py` does not exist or lacks a `register(registry)` function, you can create them. 

#### Randomizing non-range queries

By default, OpenSearch Benchmark assumes that the query to be randomized is a `"range"` query with values `"gte"`/`"gt"`, `"lte"`/`"lt"`, and, optionally, `"format"`. If this isn't the case, you can configure it to use a different query type name and different values. 

For example, to randomize the following workload operation: 

```json
{
  "name": "bbox", 
  "operation-type": "search", 
  "index": "nyc_taxis",
  "body": { 
    "size": 0,
    "query": {
      "geo_bounding_box": {
        "pickup_location": {
          "top_left": [-74.27, 40.92],
          "bottom_right": [-73.68, 40.49]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You would register the following function in `workload.py`: 

```py
registry.register_query_randomization_info("bbox", "geo_bounding_box", [["top_left"], ["bottom_right"]], [])
```

The first argument, `"bbox"`, is the operation's name. 

The second argument, `"geo_bounding_box"`, is the query type name.

The third argument is a list of lists: `[[“top_left”], [“bottom_right”]]`. The outer list's entries specify parameters for randomization because there might be different versions of the same name that represent roughly the same parameters, for example, `"gte"` or `"gt"`. Here, there's only one option for each parameter name. At least one version of each parameter's name must be present in the original query in order for it to be randomized.

The last argument is a list of optional parameters. If an optional parameter is present in the random standard value source, OpenSearch Benchmark inserts the parameter into the randomized version of the query. If it's not in the source, it's ignored. There are no optional parameters in the following example, but the typical use case would be `"format"` in a range query.

If there is no registration, the default registration is used: `registry.register_query_randomization_info(<operation_name>, “range”, [[“gte”, “gt”], [“lte”, “lt”]], [“format”])`.


The `dict` returned by the standard value source should match the parameter names you are randomizing. For example, the following is the standard value source for the preceding example:

```py
def bounding_box_source(): 
    top_longitude = random.uniform(-74.27, -73.68)
    top_latitude = random.uniform(40.49, 40.92)

    bottom_longitude = random.uniform(top_longitude, -73.68)
    bottom_latitude = random.uniform(40.49, top_latitude)

    return { 
        "top_left":[top_longitude, top_latitude],
        "bottom_right":[bottom_longitude, bottom_latitude]
    }
```



### CLI flags

Use the following CLI flags to customize randomization:

- `--randomization-enabled` turns randomization on and off. If randomization is not enabled, none of the randomization flags will be applied.

- `--randomization-repeat-frequency` or `-rf` sets the fraction of pairs drawn from the saved value pairs generated at the start of the benchmark. The value should be between `0.0` and `1.0`. Default is `0.3`. 

- `--randomization-n` sets the number `N` of value pairs generated for each operation. Default is `5000`. 

- `--randomization-alpha` sets the `alpha` parameter, which controls the spread of the `Zipf` distribution. The value should be `>=0`. Lower values increase the spread of the distribution. Default is `1.0`.
