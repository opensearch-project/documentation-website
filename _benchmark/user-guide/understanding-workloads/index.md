# Understanding workloads

OpenSearch Benchmark includes a set of [workloads](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-benchmark-workloads) that you can use to benchmark data from your cluster. Workloads contain descriptions of one or more benchmarking scenarios that use a specific document corpus to perform a benchmark against your cluster. The document corpus contains any indexes, data files, and operations invoked when the workflow runs.
