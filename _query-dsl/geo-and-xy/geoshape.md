# Geoshape query

Use a geoshape query to search for documents that contain [geopoint]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/supported-field-types/geo-point/) or [geoshape]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/supported-field-types/geo-shape/) fields. You can filter documents using a [geoshape that is defined within a query](#using-a-new-shape-definition) or use a [pre-indexed geoshape](#using-a-pre-indexed-shape-definition).

The searched document field must be mapped as `geo_point` or `geo_shape`.
{: .note}

## Spatial relations

When you provide a geoshape to the geoshape query, the geopoint and geoshape fields in the documents are matched using the following spatial relations to the provided shape.

Relation | Description | Supporting geographic field type
:--- | :--- | :--- 
`INTERSECTS` | (Default) Matches documents whose geopoint or geoshape intersects with the shape provided in the query. | `geo_point`, `geo_shape`
`DISJOINT` | Matches documents whose geoshape does not intersect with the shape provided in the query. | `geo_shape`
`WITHIN` | Matches documents whose geoshape is completely within the shape provided in the query. | `geo_shape`
`CONTAINS` | Matches documents whose geoshape completely contains the shape provided in the query. | `geo_shape`

## Defining the shape in a geoshape query

You can define the shape to filter documents in a geoshape query either by [providing a new shape definition at query time](#using-a-new-shape-definition) or by [referencing the name of a shape pre-indexed in another index](#using-a-pre-indexed-shape-definition).  

## Using a new shape definition

To provide a new shape to a geoshape query, define it in the `geo_shape` field. You must define the geoshape in [GeoJSON format](https://geojson.org/). 

The following example illustrates searching for documents containing geoshapes that match a geoshape defined at query time.

### Step 1: Create an index

First, create an index and map the `location` field as a `geo_shape`:

```json
PUT /testindex
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "geo_shape"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Step 2: Index documents

Index one document containing a point and another containing a polygon:

```json
PUT testindex/_doc/1
{
  "location": {
    "type": "point",
    "coordinates": [ 73.0515, 41.5582 ]
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

```json
PUT testindex/_doc/2
{
  "location": {
    "type": "polygon",
    "coordinates": [
      [
        [
          73.0515,
          41.5582
        ],
        [
          72.6506,
          41.5623
        ],
        [
          72.6734,
          41.7658
        ],
        [
          73.0515,
          41.5582
        ]
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Step 3: Run a geoshape query

Finally, define a geoshape to filter the documents. The following sections illustrate providing various geoshapes in a query. For more information about various geoshape formats, see [Geoshape field type]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/field-types/supported-field-types/geo-shape/). 

#### Envelope

An [`envelope`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/field-types/supported-field-types/geo-shape#envelope) is a bounding rectangle in the `[[minLon, maxLat], [maxLon, minLat]]` format. Search for documents containing  geoshape fields that intersect with the provided envelope:

```json
GET /testindex/_search
{
  "query": {
    "geo_shape": {
      "location": {
        "shape": {
          "type": "envelope",
          "coordinates": [
            [
              71.0589,
              42.3601
            ],
            [
              74.006,
              40.7128
            ]
          ]
        },
        "relation": "WITHIN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains both documents:

#### Geometry collection

Search for documents whose geoshape fields are within the provided polygons:

```json
GET /testindex/_search
{
  "query": {
    "geo_shape": {
      "location": {
        "shape": {
          "type": "geometrycollection",
          "geometries": [
            {
              "type": "polygon",
              "coordinates": [[
                [74.0060, 40.7128], 
                [73.7562, 42.6526], 
                [71.0589, 42.3601], 
                [74.0060, 40.7128]
              ]]
            },
            {
              "type": "polygon",
              "coordinates": [[
                [73.0515, 41.5582], 
                [72.6506, 41.5623], 
                [72.6734, 41.7658], 
                [73.0515, 41.5582]
              ]]
            }
          ]
        },
        "relation": "WITHIN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Geoshape queries whose geometry collection contains a linestring or a multilinestring do not support the `WITHIN` relation.
{: .note}

## Using a pre-indexed shape definition

When constructing a geoshape query, you can also reference the name of a shape pre-indexed in another index. Using this method, you can define a geoshape at index time and refer to it by name at search time. 

You can define a pre-indexed geoshape in [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) or [Well-Known Text (WKT)](https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html) format. For more information about various geoshape formats, see [Geoshape field type]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/field-types/supported-field-types/geo-shape/). 

The `indexed_shape` object supports the following parameters.

Parameter | Required/Optional | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
`id` | Required | The document ID of the document containing the pre-indexed shape. 
`index` | Optional | The name of the index containing the pre-indexed shape. Default is `shapes`.
`path` | Optional | The field name of the field containing the pre-indexed shape as a path. Default is `shape`.
`routing` | Optional | The routing of the document containing the pre-indexed shape.

The following example illustrates how to reference the name of a shape pre-indexed in another index. In this example, the index `pre-indexed-shapes` contains the shape that defines the boundaries, and the index `testindex` contains the shapes that are checked against those boundaries.

First, create the `pre-indexed-shapes` index and map the `boundaries` field for this index as a `geo_shape`:

```json
PUT /pre-indexed-shapes
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "boundaries": {
        "type": "geo_shape",
        "orientation" : "left"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

For more information about specifying a different vertex orientation for polygons, see [Polygon]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/field-types/supported-field-types/geo-shape/#polygon). 

Index a polygon specifying the search boundaries into the `pre-indexed-shapes` index. The polygon's ID is `search_triangle`. In this example, you'll index the polygon in WKT format:

```json
PUT /pre-indexed-shapes/_doc/search_triangle
{
  "boundaries": 
    "POLYGON ((74.0060 40.7128, 71.0589 42.3601, 73.7562 42.6526, 74.0060 40.7128))"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

If you haven't already done so, index one document containing a point and another document containing a polygon into the `testindex` index:

```json
PUT /testindex/_doc/1
{
  "location": {
    "type": "point",
    "coordinates": [ 73.0515, 41.5582 ]
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

```json
PUT /testindex/_doc/2
{
  "location": {
    "type": "polygon",
    "coordinates": [
      [
        [
          73.0515,
          41.5582
        ],
        [
          72.6506,
          41.5623
        ],
        [
          72.6734,
          41.7658
        ],
        [
          73.0515,
          41.5582
        ]
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Search for documents whose geoshapes are within the `search_triangle`:

```json
GET /testindex/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": {
        "match_all": {}
      },
      "filter": {
        "geo_shape": {
          "location": {
            "indexed_shape": {
              "index": "pre-indexed-shapes",
              "id": "search_triangle",
              "path": "boundaries"
            },
            "relation": "WITHIN"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains both documents:

```json

                  41.5582
                ],
                [
                  72.6506,
                  41.5623
                ],
                [
                  72.6734,
                  41.7658
                ],
                [
                  73.0515,
                  41.5582
                ]
              ]
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Querying geopoints

You can also use a geoshape query to search for documents containing geopoints. 

Geoshape queries on geopoint fields only support the default `INTERSECTS` spatial relation, so you don't need to provide the `relation` parameter.
{: .note}

{: .important }
> Geoshape queries on geopoint fields do not support the following geoshapes:
> 
> - Points
> - Linestrings
> - Multipoints
> - Multilinestrings
> - Geometry collections containing one of the preceding geoshape types

Create a mapping where `location` is a `geo_point`:

```json
PUT /testindex1
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "geo_point"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Index two points into the index. In this example, you'll provide the geopoint coordinates as strings:

```json
PUT /testindex1/_doc/1
{
  "location": "41.5623, 72.6506"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

```json
PUT /testindex1/_doc/2
{
  "location": "76.0254, 39.2467" 
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

 For information about providing geopoint coordinates in various formats, see [Formats]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/field-types/supported-field-types/geo-point/#formats). 

Search for geopoints that intersect with the provided polygon:

```json
GET /testindex1/_search
{
  "query": {
    "geo_shape": {
      "location": {

    ]
  }
}
```

Note that when you indexed the geopoints, you specified their coordinates in `"latitude, longitude"` format. When you search for matching documents, the coordinate array is in `[longitude, latitude]` format. Thus, document 1 is returned in the results but document 2 is not.

## Parameters

Geoshape queries accept the following parameters.

Parameter | Data type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- 
`ignore_unmapped` | Boolean | Specifies whether to ignore an unmapped field. If set to `true`, then the query does not return any documents that contain an unmapped field. If set to `false`, then an exception is thrown when the field is unmapped. Optional. Default is `false`.
