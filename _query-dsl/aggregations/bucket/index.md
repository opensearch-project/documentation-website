# Bucket aggregations

Bucket aggregations categorize sets of documents as buckets. The type of bucket aggregation determines whether a given document falls into a bucket or not.

You can use bucket aggregations to implement faceted navigation (usually placed as a sidebar on a search result landing page) to help your users narrow down the results.
