# Span term query

The `span_term` query is the most basic span query that matches spans containing a single term. It serves as a building block for more complex span queries.

For example, you can use the `span_term` query to:
- Find exact term matches that can be used in other span queries.
- Match specific words while maintaining position information.
- Create basic spans that can be combined with other span queries.

## Example

To try the examples in this section, complete the [setup steps]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/query-dsl/span/#setup).
{: .tip}

The following query searches for the exact term "formal":

```json
GET /clothing/_search
{
  "query": {
    "span_term": {
      "description": "formal"
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Alternatively, you can specify the search term in the `value` parameter:

```json
GET /clothing/_search
{
  "query": {
    "span_term": {
      "description": {
        "value": "formal"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

You can also specify a `boost` value in order to boost the document score:

```json
GET /clothing/_search
{
  "query": {
    "span_term": {
      "description": {
        "value": "formal",
        "boost": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The query matches documents 1 and 2 because they contain the exact term "formal". Position information is preserved for use in other span queries.
