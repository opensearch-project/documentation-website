# Language analyzer

OpenSearch supports the following language values with the `analyzer` option:
arabic, armenian, basque, bengali, brazilian, bulgarian, catalan, czech, danish, dutch, english, estonian, finnish, french, galician, german, greek, hindi, hungarian, indonesian, irish, italian, latvian, lithuanian, norwegian, persian, portuguese, romanian, russian, sorani, spanish, swedish, turkish, and thai.

To use the analyzer when you map an index, specify the value within your query. For example, to map your index with the French language analyzer, specify the `french` value for the analyzer field:

```json
 "analyzer": "french"
 ```

#### Sample Request

The following query maps an index with the language analyzer set to `french`:

```json
PUT my-index-000001

{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "text": { 
        "type": "text",
        "fields": {
          "french": { 
            "type":     "text",
            "analyzer": "french"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- TO do: each of the options needs its own section with an example. Convert table to individual sections, and then give a streamlined list with valid values. -->
