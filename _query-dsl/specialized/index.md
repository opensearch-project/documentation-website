# Specialized queries

OpenSearch supports the following specialized queries:

- [`agentic`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/query-dsl/specialized/agentic/): Uses natural language questions that are automatically planned and executed by an agent with a large language model.

- [`distance_feature`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/query-dsl/specialized/distance-feature/): Calculates document scores based on the dynamically calculated distance between the origin and a document's `date`, `date_nanos`, or `geo_point` fields. This query can skip non-competitive hits.

- [`knn`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/query-dsl/specialized/k-nn/): Used for searching raw vectors during [vector search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/vector-search/).

- [`more_like_this`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/query-dsl/specialized/more-like-this/): Finds documents similar to the provided text, document, or collection of documents.

- [`neural`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/query-dsl/specialized/neural/): Used for searching by text or image in [vector search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/neural-search/).

- [`neural_sparse`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/query-dsl/specialized/neural-sparse/): Used for vector field search in [sparse neural search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/neural-sparse-search/).

- `percolate`: Finds queries (stored as documents) that match the provided document.

- [`rank_feature`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/query-dsl/specialized/rank-feature/): Calculates scores based on the values of numeric features. This query can skip non-competitive hits.

- [`script`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/query-dsl/specialized/script/): Uses a script as a filter.

- [`script_score`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/query-dsl/specialized/script-score/): Calculates a custom score for matching documents using a script.

- [`template`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/query-dsl/specialized/template/): Allows you to use Mustache templating in queries.

- [`wrapper`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/query-dsl/specialized/wrapper/): Accepts other queries as JSON or YAML strings.
