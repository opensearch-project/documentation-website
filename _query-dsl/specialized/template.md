# Template query
Introduced 2.19
{: .label .label-purple }

Use a `template` query to create search queries that contain placeholder variables. Placeholders are specified using the `"${variable_name}"` syntax (note that the variables must be enclosed in quotation marks). When you submit a search request, these placeholders remain unresolved until they are processed by search request processors. This approach is particularly useful when your initial search request contains data that needs to be transformed or generated at runtime.

For example, you might use a template query when working with the [ml_inference search request processor]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-pipelines/ml-inference-search-request/), which converts text input into vector embeddings during the search process. The processor will replace the placeholders with the generated values before the final query is executed.

For a complete example, see [Query rewriting using template queries]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-relevance/template-query/).

## Example

The following example shows a template k-NN query with a `"vector": "${text_embedding}"` placeholder. The placeholder `"${text_embedding}"` will be replaced with embeddings generated by the `ml_inference` search request processor from the `text` input field:

```json
GET /template-knn-index/_search?search_pipeline=my_knn_pipeline
{
  "query": {
    "template": {
      "knn": {
        "text_embedding": {
          "vector": "${text_embedding}", // Placeholder for the vector field
          "k": 2
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "ext": {
    "ml_inference": {
      "text": "sneakers" // Input text for the ml_inference processor
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

To use a template query with a search request processor, you need to configure a search pipeline. The following is an example configuration for the `ml_inference` search request processor. The `input_map` maps document fields to model inputs. In this example, the `ext.ml_inference.text` source field in a document is mapped to the `inputText` field---the expected input field for the model. The `output_map` maps model outputs to document fields. In this example, the `embedding` output field from the model is mapped to the `text_embedding` destination field in your document:

```json
PUT /_search/pipeline/my_knn_pipeline
{
  "request_processors": [
    {
      "ml_inference": {
        "model_id": "Sz-wFZQBUpPSu0bsJTBG",
        "input_map": [
          {
            "inputText": "ext.ml_inference.text" // Map input text from the request
          }
        ],
        "output_map": [
          {
            "text_embedding": "embedding" // Map output to the placeholder
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

After the `ml_inference` search request processor runs, the search request is rewritten. The `vector` field contains the embeddings generated by the processor, and the `text_embedding` field contains the processor output:

```json
GET /template-knn-1/_search
{
  "query": {
    "template": {
      "knn": {
        "text_embedding": {
          "vector": [0.6328125, 0.26953125, ...], 
          "k": 2
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "ext": {
    "ml_inference": {
      "text": "sneakers",
      "text_embedding": [0.6328125, 0.26953125, ...] 
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Limitations

Template queries require at least one search request processor in order to resolve placeholders. Search request processors must be configured to produce the variables expected in the pipeline.
