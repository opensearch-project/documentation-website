# Wrapper query

The `wrapper` query lets you submit a complete query in Base64-encoded JSON format. It is useful when the query must be embedded in contexts that only support string values.

Use this query only when you need to work around system constraints. For readability and maintainability, it's better to use standard JSON-based queries when possible.

## Example use case

Letâ€™s say you want to run the following query:

```json
{
  "match": {
    "title": "headphones"
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Encode that JSON as a Base64 string. The Base64-encoded version of the above is:

```
eyAibWF0Y2giOiB7InRpdGxlIjogImhlYWRwaG9uZXMifSB9
```

Wrap this base64 encoded string in a `wrapper` query:

```json
POST /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "wrapper": {
      "query": "eyAibWF0Y2giOiB7InRpdGxlIjogImhlYWRwaG9uZXMifSB9"
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

This executes the same query as the original `match` clause.
