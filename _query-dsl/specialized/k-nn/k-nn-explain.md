# k-NN query explain
**Introduced 3.0**
{: .label .label-purple }

You can provide the `explain` parameter to understand how scores are calculated, normalized, and combined in `knn` queries. When enabled, it provides detailed information about the scoring process for each search result. This includes revealing the score normalization techniques used, how different scores were combined, and the calculations for individual subquery scores. This comprehensive insight makes it easier to understand and optimize your `knn` query results. For more information about `explain`, see [Explain API]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/explain/).

`explain` is an expensive operation in terms of both resources and time. For production clusters, we recommend using it sparingly for the purpose of troubleshooting.
{: .warning }

You can provide the `explain` parameter in a URL when running a complete `knn` query for the Faiss engine using the following syntax:

```json
GET <index>/_search?explain=true
POST <index>/_search?explain=true
```

`explain` for k-NN search for all types of queries with the Lucene engine does not return a detailed explanation as with the Faiss engine.
{: .note }

The `explain` parameter works for the following types of k-NN search with the Faiss engine:

- [Approximate k-NN search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/vector-search/vector-search-techniques/approximate-knn/)
- Approximate k-NN search with [exact search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/vector-search/vector-search-techniques/knn-score-script/)
- [Disk-based search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/vector-search/optimizing-storage/disk-based-vector-search/)
- [k-NN search with efficient filtering]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/vector-search/filter-search-knn/efficient-knn-filtering/)
- [Radial search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/vector-search/specialized-operations/radial-search-knn/)
- k-NN search with a `term` query

`explain` for k-NN search with nested fields does not return a detailed explanation as with other searches.
{: .note }

You can provide the `explain` parameter as a query parameter:

```json
GET my-knn-index/_search?explain=true
{
  "query": {
    "knn": {
      "my_vector": {
      "vector": [2, 3, 5, 7],
      "k": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Alternatively, you can provide the `explain` parameter in the request body:

```json
GET my-knn-index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "knn": {
      "my_vector": {
      "vector": [2, 3, 5, 7],
      "k": 2
      }
    }
  },
  "explain": true
}
```
