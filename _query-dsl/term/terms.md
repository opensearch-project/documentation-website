# Terms query

Use the `terms` query to search for multiple terms in the same field. For example, the following query searches for lines with the IDs `61809` and `61810`:

```json
GET shakespeare/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
      "line_id": [
        "61809",
        "61810"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

A document is returned if it matches any of the terms in the array.

By default, the maximum number of terms allowed in a `terms` query is 65,536. To change the maximum number of terms, update the `index.max_terms_count` setting.

The ability to [highlight results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/searching-data/highlight/) for terms queries may not be guaranteed, depending on the highlighter type and the number of terms in the query.
{: .note}

## Parameters

The query accepts the following parameters. All parameters are optional.

Parameter | Data type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
`<field>` | String | The field in which to search. A document is returned in the results only if its field value exactly matches at least one term, with the correct spacing and capitalization.
`boost` | Floating-point | A floating-point value that specifies the weight of this field toward the relevance score. Values above 1.0 increase the field’s relevance. Values between 0.0 and 1.0 decrease the field’s relevance. Default is 1.0.
`value_type` | String | Specifies the types of values used for filtering. Valid values are `default` and `bitmap`. If omitted, the value defaults to `default`.

## Terms lookup

Terms lookup retrieves the field values of a single document and uses them as search terms. You can use terms lookup to search for a large number of terms.

To use terms lookup, you must enable the `_source` mapping field because terms lookup fetches values from a document. The `_source` field is enabled by default.

Terms lookup tries to fetch the document field values from a shard on a local data node. Thus, using an index with a single primary shard that has full replicas on all applicable data nodes reduces network traffic.

### Example

As an example, create an index that contains student data, mapping `student_id` as a `keyword`:

```json
PUT students
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "student_id": { "type": "keyword" }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Next, index three documents that correspond to students:

```json
PUT students/_doc/1
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "student_id" : "111"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

```json
PUT students/_doc/2
{
  "name": "Mary Major",
  "student_id" : "222"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

```json
PUT students/_doc/3
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "student_id" : "333"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Create a separate index that contains class information, including the class name and an array of student IDs corresponding to the students enrolled in the class:

```json
PUT classes/_doc/101
{
  "name": "CS101",
  "enrolled" : ["111" , "222"]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

To search for students enrolled in the `CS101` class, specify the document ID of the document that corresponds to the class, the index of that document, and the path of the field in which the terms are located:

```json
GET students/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
      "student_id": {
        "index": "classes",
        "id": "101",
        "path": "enrolled"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains the documents in the `students` index for every student whose ID matches one of the values in the `enrolled` array:

```json
{
  "took": 13,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 2,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 1,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "students",
        "_id": "1",
        "_score": 1,
        "_source": {
          "name": "Jane Doe",
          "student_id": "111"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index": "students",
        "_id": "2",
        "_score": 1,
        "_source": {
          "name": "Mary Major",
          "student_id": "222"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Example: Nested fields

The second example demonstrates querying nested fields. Consider an index with the following document:

```json
PUT classes/_doc/102
{
  "name": "CS102",
  "enrolled_students" : {
    "id_list" : ["111" , "333"]
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

To search for students enrolled in `CS102`, use the dot path notation to specify the full path to the field in the `path` parameter:

```json
ET students/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
      "student_id": {
        "index": "classes",
        "id": "102",
        "path": "enrolled_students.id_list"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains the matching documents:

```json
{
  "took": 18,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 2,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 1,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "students",
        "_id": "1",
        "_score": 1,
        "_source": {
          "name": "Jane Doe",
          "student_id": "111"
        }
      },
      {
        "_index": "students",
        "_id": "3",
        "_score": 1,
        "_source": {
          "name": "John Doe",
          "student_id": "333"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Parameters

The following table lists the terms lookup parameters.

Parameter | Data type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
`index` | String | The name of the index in which to fetch field values. Required.
`id` | String | The document ID of the document from which to fetch field values. Required.
`path` | String | The name of the field from which to fetch field values. Specify nested fields using dot path notation. Required.
`routing` | String | Custom routing value of the document from which to fetch field values. Optional. Required if a custom routing value was provided when the document was indexed.
`boost` | Floating-point | A floating-point value that specifies the weight of this field toward the relevance score. Values above 1.0 increase the field’s relevance. Values between 0.0 and 1.0 decrease the field’s relevance. Default is 1.0.

## Bitmap filtering
**Introduced 2.17**
{: .label .label-purple }

The `terms` query can filter for multiple terms simultaneously. However, when the number of terms in the input filter increases to a large value (around 10,000), the resulting network and memory overhead can become significant, making the query inefficient. In such cases, consider encoding your large terms filter using a [roaring bitmap](https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap) for more efficient filtering. 

The following example assumes that you have two indexes: a `products` index, which contains all the products sold by a company, and a `customers` index, which stores filters representing customers who own specific products. 

First, create a `products` index and map `product_id` as a `keyword`:

```json
PUT /products
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "product_id": { "type": "keyword" }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Next, index three documents that correspond to products:

```json
PUT students/_doc/1
{
  "name": "Product 1",
  "product_id" : "111"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

```json
PUT students/_doc/2
{
  "name": "Product 2",
  "product_id" : "222"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

```json
PUT students/_doc/3
{
  "name": "Product 3",
  "product_id" : "333"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

To store customer bitmap filters, you'll create a `customer_filter` [binary field](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/field-types/supported-field-types/binary/) in the `customers` index. Specify `store` as `true` to store the field:

```json
PUT /customers
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "customer_filter": {
        "type": "binary",
        "store": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

For each customer, you need to generate a bitmap that represents the product IDs of the products the customer owns. This bitmap effectively encodes the filter criteria for that customer. In this example, you'll create a `terms` filter for a customer whose ID is `customer123` and who owns products `111`, `222`, and `333`.

To encode a `terms` filter for the customer, first create a roaring bitmap for the filter. This example creates a bitmap using the [PyRoaringBitMap] library, so first run `pip install pyroaring` to install the library. Then serialize the bitmap and encode it using a [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoding scheme:

```py
from pyroaring import BitMap
import base64

# Create a bitmap, serialize it into a byte string, and encode into Base64
bm = BitMap([111, 222, 333]) # product ids owned by a customer
encoded = base64.b64encode(BitMap.serialize(bm))

# Convert the Base64-encoded bytes to a string for storage or transmission
encoded_bm_str = encoded.decode('utf-8')

# Print the encoded bitmap
print(f"Encoded Bitmap: {encoded_bm_str}")
```
{% include copy.html %}

Next, index the customer filter into the `customers` index. The document ID for the filter is the same as the ID for the corresponding customer (in this example, `customer123`). The `customer_filter` field contains the bitmap you generated for this customer:

```json
POST customers/_doc/customer123
{
  "customer_filter": "OjAAAAEAAAAAAAIAEAAAAG8A3gBNAQ==" 
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Now you can run a `terms` query on the `products` index to look up a specific customer in the `customers` index. Because you're looking up a stored field instead of `_source`, set `store` to `true`. In the `value_type` field, specify the data type of the `terms` input as `bitmap`:

```json
POST /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
      "product_id": {
        "index": "customers",
        "id": "customer123",
        "path": "customer_filter",
        "store": true               
      },
      "value_type": "bitmap"      
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

You can also directly pass the bitmap to the `terms` query. In this example, the `product_id` field contains the customer filter bitmap for the customer whose ID is `customer123`:

```json
POST /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
      "product_id": "OjAAAAEAAAAAAAIAEAAAAG8A3gBNAQ==",
      "value_type": "bitmap"
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}
