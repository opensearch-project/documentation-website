# Creating detectors

Security Analytics provides the options and functionality to monitor and respond to a wide range of security threats. Detectors are the essential components that determine what to look for and how to respond to those threats. This section covers their creation and configuration. 

## Step 1. Define the detector

Defining a new detector involves naming the detector, selecting a data source and detector type, and specifying a detector schedule. You can also create alerts for the detector at this stage, although there are options to create alerts in other areas of the interface. Follow the steps in this section to define a new detector.

1. On the Detectors page, select the **Create detector** button. The Define detector page opens.
1. Give the detector a name and, as an option, add a description for the detector. 
1. In the Data source section, select the dropdown arrow and select a source for the log data.
1. In the threat detection type section, select the data type. The Sigma security rules associated with the log data are automatically populated in the Detection rules section below it.

    You can skip the next step for mapping rules if you are satisfied with those automatically populated by the system. Otherwise, go to the next step to specify select rules.

1. In the **Detection rules** section, specify only those rules you want mapped to the detector.
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/Security/select_rules.png" alt="Select or deselect rules that detector will use for findings">
* Use the toggle to the left of the rule name to select or deselect rules.
* Use the **Log type**, **Rule severity**, and **Source** dropdown menus to filter the rules you want to select from. 
* Use the **Search** bar to search for specific rules.

    To quickly select one or more known rules and dismiss others, first deselect all rules by moving the **Rule name** toggle to the left, then search for your target rule names and select each individually by moving its toggle to the right.

1. In the **Detector schedule** section, set how often the detector will run. Specify a unit of time and a corresponding number to set the interval.
1. Select the **Next** button in the lower-right corner of the screen to continue. The Configure field mapping page appears.

## Step 2. Create field mappings

The field mapping step matches field names from the rule with field names from the log index being used to provide data. Creating field mappings allows the system to accurately pass event data from the log to the detector and then use the data to trigger alerts.

The data source (log index), log type, and detection rules specified in the first step determine which fields are available for mapping. For example, when "Windows logs" is selected as the log type, this parameter, along with the specific detection rules, determines the list of rule field names available for the mapping. Similarly, the selected data source (log index) determines the list of log field names that are available for the mapping.

#### A note on field names

The field mapping process requires that you are familiar with the field names in the log index and have an understanding of the data contained in those fields. If you have an understanding of the log fields in the index, the mapping is typically a straightforward process.

Security Analytics takes advantage of prepackaged Sigma rules for security event detection. Therefore, the rule field names are derived from a Sigma rule field standard. To make them easier to identify, however, we create aliases for the Sigma rule fields based on the open source Elastic Common Schema (ECS) specification. These alias rule field names are the field names used in these steps. 

Although the ECS rule field names are largely self-explanatory, you can find predefined mappings of the Sigma rule field names with ECS rule field names, for all supported log types, in the GitHub Security Analytics repository. Navigate to the [OSMappings](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security-analytics/tree/main/src/main/resources/OSMapping) folder, select the folder named for the log type, and open the `fieldmappings.yml` file. For example, to see the Sigma rule fields that correspond to ECS rule fields for the Windows log type, open the [fieldmappings.yml file](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security-analytics/blob/main/src/main/resources/OSMapping/windows/fieldmappings.yml) in the **windows** folder.

### Pending field mappings

Once you navigate to the **Configure field mapping** page, the system attempts to automatically map fields between the two sources. Those field names that are not automatically mapped appear in the **Pending field mapping** table. In this table you can manually map rule fields to log fields, as shown in the following image.
<br><img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/Security/pending-mappings.png" alt="Field mapping example for pending mappings" width="85%">

While mapping fields, consider the following:
* The Rule field name column lists field names based on all of the prepackaged rules associated with the selected log type.
* The log field name column includes a dropdown list for each of the rule fields. Each dropdown list contains field names extracted from the log index.
* To map a rule field name to a log field name, use the dropdown arrow to open the list of log fields and select the log field name from the list. To search for names in the log field list, enter text in the **Select a mapping field** box.
<br><img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/Security/log-field.png" alt="Field mapping example for pending mappings" width="60%">
* Once the log field name is selected and mapped to the rule field name, the icon in the Status column to the right changes to a green check mark.
* Make as many matches between field names as possible to complete an accurate mapping for rule and log fields. 

### Default field mappings

The **Default mapped fields** table contains mappings that the system created automatically after defining the detector. As shown in the image that follows, when the field names are similar to one another the system can successfully match the two.
<br><img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/Security/default-mappings.png" alt="Field mapping example for pending mappings" width="85%">

Although these automatic matches are normally dependable, it's still a good idea to review the mappings and verify that they are correct and matched as expected. If you find a mapping that doesn't appear to be accurate, you can use the dropdown list as described in the [Pending field mappings](#pending-field-mappings) section above to correct the field mapping.  

After completing the mappings, select the **Next** button in the lower-right corner of the screen. The **Set up alerts** page appears and displays settings for an alert trigger.

## Step 3. Set up alerts

At this stage, setting up alerts is optional for creating a new detector. Alerts can be configured at any time, including from the Findings window. This section describes the process for defining the alert conditions during creation of a detector. To see how to initiate creation of alerts from the Findings window, see [The findings list]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security-analytics/usage/findings/#the-findings-list).

To skip directly to generating findings from the detector, select the **Remove alert trigger** button and then the **Next** button in the lower-right corner of the screen. Review the detector's definition and then select the **Create** button in the lower-right corner of the screen. The detector is created.

To set up an alert for the detector at this stage of detector creation, continue with the following steps:

1. In the **Trigger name** box, enter a name for the trigger.
1. To define rule matches for the alert, select security rules, severity levels, and tags.
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/Security/alert_rules.png" alt="Rules used to define an alert">
* Select one rule or multiple rules that will trigger the alert. Put the cursor in the **Rule names** box and type a name to search for it. To remove a rule name, select the **X** beside the name. To remove all rule names, select the **X** beside the dropdown menu's down arrow.
<br><img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/Security/rule_name_delete.png" alt="Deletes all selected rules">
* Select one or more rule severities as conditions for the alert.
* Select from a list of tags to include as conditions for the alert.
1. To define a notification for the alert, assign an alert severity, select a channel for the notification, and customize a message generated for the alert.
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/Security/alert_notify.png" alt="Notification settings for the alert">
* Assign a level of severity for the alert to give the recipient an indication of its urgency.
* Select a channel for the notification. Examples include Slack, Chime, or email. Select the  **Manage channels** link to the right of the field to link the notification to a preferred channel.
* Select the **Show notify message** label to expand message preferences. You can add a subject for the message and a note to inform recipients of the nature of the message.
1. After configuring the conditions in the fields above, select the **Next** button in the lower-right corner of the screen. The Review and create page opens.

After reviewing the specifications for the detector, select the **Create** button in the lower-right corner of the screen to create the detector. The screen returns to the list of all detectors, and the new detector appears in the list.
