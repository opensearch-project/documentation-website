# Rule APIs

The following APIs can be used for a number of tasks related to rules, from searching for pre-packaged rules to creating and updating custom rules.

## Create Custom Rule

The Create custom rule API uses Sigma security rule formatting to create a custom rule. For information on how to write a rule in Sigma format, see information provided at [Sigma's GitHub repository](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma).
