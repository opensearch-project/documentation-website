# Threat intelligence

Threat intelligence in Security Analytics offers the capability to integrate your threat intelligence feeds. Feeds comprise indicators of compromise (IOCs), which search for malicious indicators in your data by setting up threat intelligence monitors. These monitors generate findings and can send notifications when malicious IPs, domains, or hashes from the threat intelligence feeds match your data.


You can interact with threat intelligence in the following ways:

- Threat intelligence APsI: To configure threat intelligence using API operations, see [Threat Intelligence APIs]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security-analytics/threat-intelligence/api/threat-intel-api/).
- OpenSearch Dashboards: To configure and use threat intelligence through the OpenSearch Dashboards interface, see [Getting started]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security-analytics/threat-intelligence/getting-started/).
