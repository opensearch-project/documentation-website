# Working with detectors

After creating a detector, it appears on the Threat detectors page along with others saved to the system. You can then perform a number of actions for each detector, from editing its details to changing its status. See the following sections for description of the available actions.

## Threat detector list

The list of threat detectors includes the search bar, the **Status** dropdown list, and the **Log type** dropdown list.
* Use the search bar to filter by detector name.
* Select the **Status** dropdown list to filter detectors in the list by Active and Inactive status.
* Select the **Log type** dropdown list to filter detectors by any log type that appears in the list (the options depend on the detectors present in the list and their log types).

### Editing a detector

To edit a detector, begin by selecting the link to the detector in the Detector name column of the list. The detector's details window opens and shows details about the detector's configuration.

* In the upper-right corner of the window, you can select **View alerts** to go to the Alerts window or **View findings** to go to the Findings window. You can also select **Actions** to perform actions for the detector. See [Detector actions]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security-analytics/usage/detectors/#detector-actions).
* In the lower portion of the window, select the **Edit** button for either Detector details or Detection rules to make changes accordingly.
* Finally, you can select the **Field mappings** tab to edit field mappings for the detector, or select the **Alert triggers** tab to make edits to alerts associated with the detector.
