# Supported log types

Logs contain raw data about events that happen throughout a system and in its separate parts. This reference describes each standard log type supported by Security Analytics and the automatic mappings they contain.

For more information about field mappings, see [Working with Log types > About field mappings]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security-analytics/sec-analytics-config/log-types#about-field-mappings).

For more information about log types and detectors, see [Creating detectors]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security-analytics/sec-analytics-config/detectors-config/).
