# Commands  
PPL supports most common [SQL functions]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/sql/functions/), including [relevance search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/sql/full-text/), but also introduces several more functions (called _commands_), which are available in PPL only.
