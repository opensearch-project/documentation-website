# Relevance functions

Relevance-based functions enable users to search an index for documents based on query relevance. These functions are built on top of OpenSearch engine search queries, but in-memory execution within the plugin is not supported.

You can use these functions for global query filtering, such as in condition expressions within `WHERE` or `HAVING` clauses. For more details about relevance-based search, see [Relevance Based Search With SQL/PPL Query Engine](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql/issues/182).

## MATCH

**Usage**: `MATCH(<field_expression>, <query_expression>[, <option>=<option_value>]*)`

Maps to the `match` query in the OpenSearch engine. Returns documents in which the specified field matches the provided text, number, date, or Boolean value.

**Parameters**:

- `<field_expression>` (Required): The field to search in.
- `<query_expression>` (Required): The text, number, date, or Boolean value to match.
- `<option>` (Optional): Additional options specified as `<option>=<option_value>` pairs.

  The following options are available:

  - `analyzer`: Specifies which analyzer to use for the query.
  - `auto_generate_synonyms_phrase`: Whether to auto-generate synonym phrase queries.
  - `fuzziness`: Controls fuzzy matching behavior.
  - `max_expansions`: The maximum number of terms the query can expand to.
  - `prefix_length`: The number of beginning characters left unchanged for fuzzy matching.
  - `fuzzy_transpositions`: Whether fuzzy matching includes transpositions of two adjacent characters.
  - `fuzzy_rewrite`: The method used to rewrite the query.
  - `lenient`: Whether format-based failures should be ignored.
  - `operator`: The Boolean logic used to interpret text in the query value.
  - `minimum_should_match`: The minimum number of clauses that must match.
  - `zero_terms_query`: What to return when the analyzer removes all tokens.
  - `boost`: A floating-point value used to decrease or increase relevance scores.

**Return type**: `BOOLEAN`

#### Examples

The following example uses only the required parameters, with all optional parameters set to default values:
  
```sql
source=accounts
| where match(address, 'Street')
| fields lastname, address
```
{% include copy.html %}
  
The query returns the following results:
  
| lastname | address |
| --- | --- |
| Bond | 671 Bristol Street |
| Bates | 789 Madison Street |
  
The following example shows how to set custom values for the optional parameters:
  
```sql
source=accounts
| where match(firstname, 'Hattie', operator='AND', boost=2.0)
| fields lastname
```
{% include copy.html %}
  
The query returns the following results:

| Bond |
  
## MATCH_PHRASE

**Usage**: `MATCH_PHRASE(<field_expression>, <query_expression>[, <option>=<option_value>]*)`

  The following options are available:

  - `analyzer`: Specifies which analyzer to use for the query.
  - `slop`: The maximum number of positions between matching terms.

- `MULTI_MATCH(<query_expression>[, <option>=<option_value>]*)`.

Maps to the `multi_match query` in the OpenSearch engine. Returns documents in which one or more specified fields match the provided text, number, date, or Boolean value.

**Two syntax forms are supported**:
1. **With explicit fields** (classic syntax): `multi_match([field_list], query, ...)`
2. **Without fields** (search default fields): `multi_match(query, ...)`

When fields are omitted, the query searches in the fields specified by the `index.query.default_field` setting.

You can boost specific fields using the `^` symbol. Boosts are multipliers that weigh matches in one field more heavily than matches in other fields. You can specify fields using double quotation marks, single quotation marks, backticks, or without quotation marks. You can also search all fields using `"*"` (the star symbol must be enclosed in quotation marks). The boost value is optional and should be specified after the field name, separated by the `^` character or white space:
- `multi_match(["Tags" ^ 2, 'Title' 3.4, `Body`, Comments ^ 0.3], ...)`.
- `multi_match(["*"], ...)`.
- `multi_match("search text", ...)` (searches default fields).

**Parameters**:

- `<field_expression+>` (Optional): List of fields to search in, with optional boost values.
- `<query_expression>` (Required): The text, number, date, or Boolean value to match.
- `<option>` (Optional): Additional options specified as `<option>=<option_value>` pairs.

  The following options are available:

  - `analyzer`: Specifies which analyzer to use for the query.
  - `auto_generate_synonyms_phrase`: Whether to auto-generate synonym phrase queries.
  - `cutoff_frequency`: Allows high frequency terms to be put into a query.
  - `fuzziness`: Controls fuzzy matching behavior.
  - `fuzzy_transpositions`: Whether fuzzy matching includes transpositions of two adjacent characters.

  - `minimum_should_match`: The minimum number of clauses that must match.
  - `operator`: The Boolean logic used to interpret text in the query value.
  - `prefix_length`: The number of beginning characters left unchanged for fuzzy matching.
  - `tie_breaker`: A value between 0.0 and 1.0 to use as a tiebreaker for fields with the same relevance.
  - `type`: How the multi_match query should be executed internally.
  - `slop`: The maximum number of positions between matching terms (for phrase queries).
  - `boost`: A floating-point value used to decrease or increase relevance scores.

**Return type**: `BOOLEAN`

#### Examples

The following example uses explicit field specification with required parameters only:
  
```sql
source=books
| where multi_match(['title'], 'Pooh House')
| fields id, title, author
```

| id | title | author |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The House at Pooh Corner | Alan Alexander Milne |
| 2 | Winnie-the-Pooh | Alan Alexander Milne |

## Limitations

Relevance functions execute only in the OpenSearch query DSL, not in memory. Relevance searches can fail if a query is too complex to translate into DSL, particularly when a relevance function follows complex PPL operations.

To ensure correct execution, place relevance functions as close to the `search` command as possible. This increases the likelihood that the functions are eligible for push-down optimization.

**Example of problematic query structure**:
```sql
search source = people
| rename firstname as name
| dedup account_number
| fields name, account_number, balance, employer
| where match(employer, 'Open Search')
| stats count() by city
```

Place the `where` command containing the relevance function immediately after the `search` command so that the function can be optimized and executed in the OpenSearch DSL.

**Recommended query structure**:
```sql
search source = people
| where match(employer, 'Open Search')
| rename firstname as name
| dedup account_number
| fields name, account_number, balance, employer
| stats count() by city
```
