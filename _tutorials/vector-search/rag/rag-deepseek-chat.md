# RAG using the DeepSeek Chat API

This tutorial shows you how to implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using [Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/) and the [DeepSeek chat model](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/api/create-chat-completion).

If you are using self-managed OpenSearch instead of Amazon OpenSearch Service, obtain a DeepSeek API key and create a connector to the DeepSeek chat model using [the blueprint](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons/blob/main/docs/remote_inference_blueprints/deepseek_connector_chat_blueprint.md). For more information about creating a connector, see [Connectors]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/remote-models/connectors/). Then go directly to [Step 5](#step-5-create-and-test-the-model).

Replace the placeholders beginning with the prefix `your_` with your own values.
{: .note}

## Prerequisites

Before you start, fulfill the following prerequisites.

When configuring Amazon settings, only change the values mentioned in this tutorial. Keep all other settings at their default values.
{: .important}

### Obtain a DeepSeek API key

If you don't have a DeepSeek API key already, obtain one before starting this tutorial. 

### Create an OpenSearch cluster

Go to the [Amazon OpenSearch Service console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/aos/home) and create an OpenSearch domain.

Note the domain Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and URL; you'll use them in the following steps.

## Step 1: Store the API key in AWS Secrets Manager

Store your DeepSeek API key in [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html):

1. Open AWS Secrets Manager.
1. Select **Store a new secret**.
1. Select **Other type of secret**.
1. Create a key-value pair with **my_deepseek_key** as the key and your DeepSeek API key as the value.
1. Name your secret `my_test_deepseek_secret`.

Note the secret ARN; you'll use it in the following steps.

## Step 2: Create an IAM role

To use the secret created in Step 1, you must create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with read permissions for the secret. This IAM role will be configured in the connector and will allow the connector to read the secret.

Go to the IAM console, create a new IAM role named `my_deepseek_secret_role`, and add the following trust policy and permissions:

- Custom trust policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "es.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy.html %}

- Permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
        "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "your_secret_arn_created_in_step1"
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy.html %}

Note the role ARN; you'll use it in the following steps.

## Step 3: Configure an IAM role in Amazon OpenSearch Service

Follow these steps to configure an IAM role in Amazon OpenSearch Service.

### Step 3.1: Create an IAM role for signing connector requests

Generate a new IAM role specifically for signing your Create Connector API request.

Create an IAM role named `my_create_deepseek_connector_role` with the following trust policy and permissions:

- Custom trust policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "your_iam_user_arn"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy.html %}

You'll use the `your_iam_user_arn` IAM user to assume the role in Step 4.1.

- Permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iam:PassRole",
      "Resource": "your_iam_role_arn_created_in_step2"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "es:ESHttpPost",
      "Resource": "your_opensearch_domain_arn"
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy.html %}

Note this role ARN; you'll use it in the following steps.

### Step 3.2: Map a backend role

Follow these steps to map a backend role:

1. Log in to OpenSearch Dashboards and select **Security** on the top menu.
2. Select **Roles**, and then select the **ml_full_access** role. 
3. On the **ml_full_access** role details page, select **Mapped users**, and then select **Manage mapping**. 
4. Enter the IAM role ARN created in Step 3.1 in the **Backend roles** field, as shown in the following image.
    ![Mapping a backend role]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/vector-search-tutorials/mapping_iam_role_arn.png)
4. Select **Map**. 

The IAM role is now successfully configured in your OpenSearch cluster.

## Step 4: Create a connector

Follow these steps to create a connector for the DeepSeek chat model. For more information about creating a connector, see [Connectors]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/remote-models/connectors/).

### Step 4.1: Get temporary credentials

Use the credentials of the IAM user specified in Step 3.1 to assume the role:

```bash
aws sts assume-role --role-arn your_iam_role_arn_created_in_step3.1 --role-session-name your_session_name
```
{% include copy.html %}

Copy the temporary credentials from the response and configure them in `~/.aws/credentials`:

```ini
[default]
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_of_role_created_in_step3.1
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_of_role_created_in_step3.1
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your_session_token_of_role_created_in_step3.1
```
{% include copy.html %}

### Step 4.2: Create a connector

Add the DeepSeek API endpoint to the trusted URL list:

```json
PUT /_cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "plugins.ml_commons.trusted_connector_endpoints_regex": [
      """^https://api\.deepseek\.com/.*$"""
    ]
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Run the following Python code with the temporary credentials configured in `~/.aws/credentials`:
 
```python
import boto3
import requests 
from requests_aws4auth import AWS4Auth

host = 'your_amazon_opensearch_domain_endpoint'
region = 'your_amazon_opensearch_domain_region'
service = 'es'

credentials = boto3.Session().get_credentials()
awsauth = AWS4Auth(credentials.access_key, credentials.secret_key, region, service, session_token=credentials.token)

path = '/_plugins/_ml/connectors/_create'
url = host + path

payload = {
  "name": "DeepSeek Chat",
  "description": "Test connector for DeepSeek Chat",
  "version": "1",
  "protocol": "http",
  "parameters": {
    "endpoint": "api.deepseek.com",
    "model": "deepseek-chat"
  },
  "credential": {
    "secretArn": "your_secret_arn_created_in_step1",
    "roleArn": "your_iam_role_arn_created_in_step2"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_type": "predict",
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "https://${parameters.endpoint}/v1/chat/completions",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${credential.secretArn.my_deepseek_key}"
      },
      "request_body": "{ \"model\": \"${parameters.model}\", \"messages\": ${parameters.messages} }"
    }
  ]
}

headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

r = requests.post(url, auth=awsauth, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(r.status_code)
print(r.text)
```
{% include copy.html %}

The script outputs a connector ID:

```json
{"connector_id":"duRJsZQBFSAM-WcznrIw"}
```

Note the connector ID; you'll use it in the next step.

## Step 5: Create and test the model

Log in to OpenSearch Dashboards, open the DevTools console, and run the following requests to create and test the DeepSeek chat model.

1. Create a model group:

    ```json
    POST /_plugins/_ml/model_groups/_register
    {
      "name": "DeepSeek Chat model",
      "description": "Test model group for DeepSeek model"
    }
    ```
    {% include copy-curl.html %}

    The response contains the model group ID:

    ```json
    {
      "model_group_id": "UylKsZQBts7fa6byEx2M",
      "status": "CREATED"
    }
    ```

1. Register the model:

    ```json
    POST /_plugins/_ml/models/_register
    {
      "name": "DeepSeek Chat model",
      "function_name": "remote",
      "description": "DeepSeek Chat model",
      "model_group_id": "UylKsZQBts7fa6byEx2M",
      "connector_id": "duRJsZQBFSAM-WcznrIw"
    }
    ```
    {% include copy-curl.html %}

    The response contains the model ID:

    ```json
    {
      "task_id": "VClKsZQBts7fa6bypR0a",
      "status": "CREATED",
      "model_id": "VSlKsZQBts7fa6bypR02"
    }
    ```

1. Deploy the model:

    ```json
    POST /_plugins/_ml/models/VSlKsZQBts7fa6bypR02/_deploy
    ```
    {% include copy-curl.html %}

    The response contains a task ID for the deployment operation:

    ```json
    {
      "task_id": "d-RKsZQBFSAM-Wcz3bKO",
      "task_type": "DEPLOY_MODEL",
      "status": "COMPLETED"
    }
    ```

1. Test the model:

    ```json
    POST /_plugins/_ml/models/VSlKsZQBts7fa6bypR02/_predict
    {
      "parameters": {
        "messages": [

            "content": "Hello!"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
    {% include copy-curl.html %}

    The response contains the text generated by the model:

    ```json
    {
      "inference_results": [
        {
          "output": [

          ],
          "status_code": 200
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## Step 6: Configure RAG

Follow these steps to configure RAG.

### Step 6.1: Create a search pipeline

Create a search pipeline with a [RAG processor]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-pipelines/rag-processor/):

```json
PUT /_search/pipeline/my-conversation-search-pipeline-deepseek-chat
{
  "response_processors": [
    {
      "retrieval_augmented_generation": {
        "tag": "Demo pipeline",
        "description": "Demo pipeline Using DeepSeek Chat",
        "model_id": "VSlKsZQBts7fa6bypR02",
        "context_field_list": [
          "text"
        ],
        "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant.",
        "user_instructions": "Generate a concise and informative answer in less than 100 words for the given question"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Step 6.2: Create a vector database

Follow steps 1 and 2 of [this tutorial]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/neural-search-tutorial/) to create an embedding model and a vector index. Then ingest sample data into the index:

```json
POST _bulk
{"index": {"_index": "my-nlp-index", "_id": "1"}}
{"text": "Chart and table of population level and growth rate for the Ogden-Layton metro area from 1950 to 2023.

```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Step 6.3: Search the index

Run a vector search to retrieve documents from the vector database and use the DeepSeek model for RAG:

```json
GET /my-nlp-index/_search?search_pipeline=my-conversation-search-pipeline-deepseek-chat
{
  "query": {
    "neural": {
      "passage_embedding": {
        "query_text": "What's the population increase of New York City from 2021 to 2023? How is the trending comparing with Miami?",
        "model_id": "USkHsZQBts7fa6bybx3G",
        "k": 5
      }
    }
  },
  "size": 4,
  "_source": [
    "text"
  ],
  "ext": {
    "generative_qa_parameters": {      
      "llm_model": "deepseek-chat",
      "llm_question": "What's the population increase of New York City from 2021 to 2023? How is the trending comparing with Miami?",
      "context_size": 5,
      "timeout": 15
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response includes both the relevant documents retrieved from the vector search (in the `hits` array) and the generated answer from the DeepSeek model (in the `ext.retrieval_augmented_generation` object):
