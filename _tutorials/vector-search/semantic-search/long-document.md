# Semantic search using text chunking

This tutorial shows you how to use text chunking to run semantic search on long documents in OpenSearch 2.19 or later. 

In this tutorial, you'll use the following OpenSearch components:
- [Text chunking processor]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ingest-pipelines/processors/text-chunking/)
- [ML inference ingest processor]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ingest-pipelines/processors/ml-inference/)
- [ML inference search request processor]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/search-pipelines/ml-inference-search-request/) 
- [Template query]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/search-template/)

Replace the placeholders beginning with the prefix `your_` with your own values.
{: .note}

## Step 1: Create an embedding model

In this tutorial, you'll use the [Amazon Bedrock Titan Text Embeddings model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/titan-embedding-models.html). 

If using Python, you can create an Amazon Bedrock Titan embedding connector and test the model using the [opensearch-py-ml](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py-ml) client CLI. The CLI automates many configuration steps, making setup faster and reducing the chance of errors. For more information about using the CLI, see the [CLI documentation](https://opensearch-project.github.io/opensearch-py-ml/cli/index.html#).
{: .tip}

If using self-managed OpenSearch, create a model using [the blueprint](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons/blob/main/docs/remote_inference_blueprints/bedrock_connector_titan_embedding_blueprint.md). 

If using Amazon OpenSearch Service, use [this Python notebook](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons/blob/main/docs/tutorials/aws/AIConnectorHelper.ipynb) to create the model. Alternatively, you can manually create a connector by following [this tutorial]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/vector-search/tutorials/semantic-search/semantic-search-bedrock-titan/).

### Step 1.1: Create a connector

To create a connector, send the following request. Because you'll use the [ML inference processor]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ingest-pipelines/processors/ml-inference/) in this tutorial, you don't need to specify a pre- or post-processing function in the connector:

```json
POST _plugins/_ml/connectors/_create
{
  "name": "Amazon Bedrock Connector: embedding",
  "description": "The connector to bedrock Titan embedding model",
  "version": 1,
  "protocol": "aws_sigv4",
  "parameters": {
    "region": "us-west-2",
    "service_name": "bedrock",
    "model": "amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0",
    "dimensions": 1024,
    "normalize": true,
    "embeddingTypes": ["float"]
  },
  "credential": {
    "access_key": "your_aws_access_key",
    "secret_key": "your_aws_secret_key",
    "session_token": "your_aws_session_token"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_type": "predict",
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "https://bedrock-runtime.${parameters.region}.amazonaws.com/model/${parameters.model}/invoke",
      "headers": {
        "content-type": "application/json",
        "x-amz-content-sha256": "required"
      },
      "request_body": "{ \"inputText\": \"${parameters.inputText}\", \"dimensions\": ${parameters.dimensions}, \"normalize\": ${parameters.normalize}, \"embeddingTypes\": ${parameters.embeddingTypes} }"
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains a connector ID:

```json
{
  "connector_id": "vhR15JQBLopfJ2xsx9p5"
}
```

Note the connector ID; you'll use it in the next step.

### Step 1.2: Register the model

To register the model, send the following request:

```json
POST _plugins/_ml/models/_register?deploy=true
{
  "name": "Bedrock embedding model",
  "function_name": "remote",
  "description": "Bedrock text embedding model v2",
  "connector_id": "vhR15JQBLopfJ2xsx9p5"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains the model ID:

```json
{
  "task_id": "xRR35JQBLopfJ2xsO9pU",
  "status": "CREATED",
  "model_id": "xhR35JQBLopfJ2xsO9pr"
}
```

Note the model ID; you'll use it in the next step.

### Step 1.3: Test the model

To test the model, send the following request:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/xhR35JQBLopfJ2xsO9pr/_predict
{
    "parameters": {
        "inputText": "hello world"
    }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains the embeddings generated by the model:

```json
{
  "inference_results": [
    {
      "output": [
        {
          "name": "response",
          "dataAsMap": {
            "embedding": [
              -0.020442573353648186,...
            ],
            "embeddingsByType": {
              "float": [
                -0.020442573353648186, ...
              ]
            },
            "inputTextTokenCount": 3.0
          }
        }
      ],
      "status_code": 200
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 2: Create an ingest pipeline

Many text embedding models have input size limitations. The [Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/titan-embedding-models.html) supports a maximum of 8,192 text tokens. To process long documents, you need to split them into smaller chunks and send each chunk to the model. The [text chunking processor]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ingest-pipelines/processors/text-chunking/) splits the original document into smaller pieces, and the [ML inference processor]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ingest-pipelines/processors/ml-inference/) generates embeddings for each chunk. To create an ingest pipeline containing both processors, send the following request:

```json
PUT _ingest/pipeline/bedrock-text-embedding-pipeline
{
  "description": "ingest reviews, generate embedding, and format chunks",
  "processors": [
    {
      "text_chunking": {
        "algorithm": {
          "fixed_token_length": {
            "token_limit": 100,
            "overlap_rate": 0.2,
            "tokenizer": "standard"
          }
        },
        "field_map": {
          "passage_text": "passage_chunk"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "foreach": {
        "field": "passage_chunk",
        "processor": {
          "set": {
            "field": "_ingest._value",
            "value": {
              "text": "{{_ingest._value}}"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "foreach": {
        "field": "passage_chunk",
        "processor": {
          "ml_inference": {
            "model_id": "xhR35JQBLopfJ2xsO9pr",
            "input_map": [
              {
                "inputText": "_ingest._value.text"
              }
            ],
            "output_map": [
              {
                "_ingest._value.embedding": "embedding"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

To test the pipeline, send the following request:

```json
POST _ingest/pipeline/bedrock-text-embedding-pipeline/_simulate
{
  "docs": [
    {
      "_index": "testindex",
      "_id": "1",
      "_source":{
         "passage_text": "Ingest pipelines\nAn ingest pipeline is a sequence of processors that are applied to documents as they are ingested into an index.

      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response shows the processed document, which has been split into chunks and includes embeddings for each chunk:

```json

To create a vector index, send the following request:

```json
PUT opensearch_docs
{
  "settings": {
    "index.knn": true,
    "default_pipeline": "bedrock-text-embedding-pipeline"
  },

          },
          "embedding": {
            "type": "knn_vector",
            "dimension": 1024
          }
        }
      },
      "passage_text": {
        "type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Ingest test data into the index:

{% include copy-curl.html %}

To verify that the documents were properly processed, search the index to view the generated chunks and embeddings:

```json
GET opensearch_docs/_search
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Step 4: Search using an ML inference processor

Create a search pipeline with an ML inference processor that converts input text into embeddings:

```json
PUT _search/pipeline/bedrock_semantic_search_pipeline
{
  "request_processors": [
    {
      "ml_inference": {
        "model_id": "xhR35JQBLopfJ2xsO9pr",
        "input_map": [
          {
            "inputText": "ext.ml_inference.params.text"
          }
        ],
        "output_map": [
          {
            "ext.ml_inference.params.vector": "embedding"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Use the following template query to run a semantic search:

```json
GET opensearch_docs/_search?search_pipeline=bedrock_semantic_search_pipeline
{
  "query": {
    "template": {
      "nested": {
        "path": "passage_chunk",
        "query": {
          "knn": {
            "passage_chunk.embedding": {
              "vector": "${ext.ml_inference.params.vector}",
              "k": 5
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "ext": {
    "ml_inference": {
      "params": {
        "text": "What's OpenSearch ingest pipeline"
      }
    }
  },
  "_source": {
    "excludes": [
      "passage_chunk"
    ]
  },
  "size": 1
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The pipeline maps `inputText` to `ext.ml_inference.params.text`. During input processing, the pipeline retrieves the value from the path `ext.ml_inference.params.text` in the search request. In this example, the value in this path is `"What's OpenSearch ingest pipeline"`, and this value is passed to the model in the `inputText` parameter.

During search, the search query references `"vector": "${ext.ml_inference.params.vector}"`. This vector value isn't provided in the initial search request; instead, the ML inference processor generates it by invoking the Amazon Bedrock Titan Embeddings model. The model creates an embedding vector from your search text and stores the vector in `ext.ml_inference.params.vector`. OpenSearch then uses this generated vector to find similar documents:

```json
{
  "took": 398,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 3,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 0.78014797,

        "_score": 0.78014797,
        "_source": {
          "passage_text": """Ingest pipelines
An ingest pipeline is a sequence of processors that are applied to documents as they are ingested into an index. Each processor in a pipeline performs a specific task, such as filtering, transforming, or enriching data.

Processors are customizable tasks that run in a sequential order as they appear in the request body. This order is important, as each processor depends on the output of the previous processor. The modified documents appear in your index after the processors are applied.

OpenSearch ingest pipelines compared to OpenSearch Data Prepper
OpenSeach ingest pipelines run within the OpenSearch cluster, whereas OpenSearch Data Prepper is an external component that runs on the OpenSearch cluster.

OpenSearch ingest pipelines perform actions on indexes and are preferred for use cases involving pre-processing simple datasets, machine learning (ML) processors, and vector embedding processors. OpenSearch ingest pipelines are recommended for simple data pre-processing and small datasets.

OpenSearch Data Prepper is recommended for any data processing tasks it supports, particularly when dealing with large datasets and complex data pre-processing requirements. It streamlines the process of transferring and fetching large datasets while providing robust capabilities for intricate data preparation and transformation operations. Refer to the OpenSearch Data Prepper documentation for more information.

OpenSearch ingest pipelines can only be managed using Ingest API operations.

Prerequisites
The following are prerequisites for using OpenSearch ingest pipelines:

When using ingestion in a production environment, your cluster should contain at least one node with the node roles permission set to ingest. For information about setting up node roles within a cluster, see Cluster Formation.
If the OpenSearch Security plugin is enabled, you must have the cluster_manage_pipelines permission to manage ingest pipelines.
Define a pipeline
A pipeline definition describes the sequence of an ingest pipeline and can be written in JSON format. An ingest pipeline consists of the following:

{
    "description" : "..."
    "processors" : [...]
}
Request body fields
Field	Required	Type	Description
processors	Required	Array of processor objects	A component that performs a specific data processing task as the data is being ingested into OpenSearch.
description	Optional	String	A description of the ingest pipeline.
