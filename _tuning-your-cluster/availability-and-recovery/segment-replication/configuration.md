# Segment replication configuration

Segment replication is an experimental feature. Therefore, we do not recommend the use of segment replication in a production environment. For updates on the progress of segment replication or if you want to leave feedback that could help improve the feature, see the [Segment replication issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/2194).
{: .warning }

To enable the segment replication type, reference the steps below.

## Enabling the feature flag

There are several methods for enabling segment replication, depending on the install type. You will also need to set the replication strategy to `SEGMENT` when creating the index.

### Enable on a node using a tarball install

The flag is toggled using a new jvm parameter that is set either in `OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS` or in config/jvm.options.

1. Option 1: Update config/jvm.options by adding the following line:

    ````json
    -Dopensearch.experimental.feature.replication_type.enabled=true
    ````

1. Option 2: Use the `OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable:

    ````json
    export OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS="-Dopensearch.experimental.feature.replication_type.enabled=true"
    ````
1. Option 3: For developers using Gradle, update run.gradle by adding the following lines:

    ````json
    testClusters {
      runTask {
        testDistribution = 'archive'
        if (numZones > 1) numberOfZones = numZones
        if (numNodes > 1) numberOfNodes = numNodes
        systemProperty 'opensearch.experimental.feature.replication_type.enabled', 'true'
      }
    }
    ````

### Enable with Docker containers

If you're running Docker, add the following line to docker-compose.yml underneath the `opensearch-node` and `environment` section:

````json
OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS="-Dopensearch.experimental.feature.replication_type.enabled=true" # Enables segment replication
````

### Setting the replication strategy on the index

To set the replication strategy to segment replication, create an index with replication.type set to `SEGMENT`:

````json
PUT /my-index1
{
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "replication.type": "SEGMENT" 
    }
  }
}
````

## Known limitations

1. Enabling segment replication for an existing index requires [reindexing](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/3685).
1. Rolling upgrades are currently not supported. Full cluster restarts are required when upgrading indexes using segment replication. [Issue 3881](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/3881).
1. [Cross-cluster replication](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/4090) does not currently use segment replication to copy between clusters.
1. Increased network congestion on primary shards. [Issue - Optimize network bandwidth on primary shards](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/4245).
1. Shard allocation algorithms have not been updated to evenly spread primary shards across nodes.
1. Integration with remote-backed storage as the source of replication is [currently unsupported](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/4448).
