# Workload management

Workload management allows you to group search traffic and isolate network resources, preventing the overuse of network resources by specific requests. It offers the following benefits:

- Tenant-level admission control and reactive query management. When resource usage exceeds configured limits, it automatically identifies and cancels demanding queries, ensuring fair resource distribution.

- Tenant-level isolation within the cluster for search workloads, operating at the node level.

## Installing workload management

To install workload management, use the following command: 

```json
./bin/opensearch-plugin install workload-management
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Query groups

A _query group_ is a logical grouping of tasks with defined resource limits. System administrators can dynamically manage query groups using the Workload Management APIs. These query groups can be used to create search requests with resource limits. 

### Permissions

Only users with administrator-level permissions can create and update query groups using the Workload Management APIs.

### Operating modes

The following operating modes determine the operating level for a query group:

- **Disabled mode**: Workload management is disabled.

- **Enabled mode**: Workload management is enabled and will cancel and reject queries once the query group's configured thresholds are reached.

- **Monitor_only mode** (Default): Workload management will monitor tasks but will not cancel or reject any queries.

### Example request

The following example request adds a query group named `analytics`:

```json
PUT _wlm/query_group
{
  “name”: “analytics”,
  “resiliency_mode”: “enforced”,
  “resource_limits”: {
    “cpu”: 0.4,
    “memory”: 0.2
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

When creating a query group, make sure that the sum of the resource limits for a single resource, such as `cpu` or `memory`, does not exceed `1`.

### Example response

OpenSearch responds with the set resource limits and the `_id` for the query group:

```json
{
  "_id":"preXpc67RbKKeCyka72_Gw",
  "name":"analytics",
  "resiliency_mode":"enforced",
  "resource_limits":{
    "cpu":0.4,
    "memory":0.2
  },
  "updated_at":1726270184642
}
```

## Using `queryGroupID`

You can associate a query request with a `queryGroupID` to manage and allocate resources within the limits defined by the query group. By using this ID, request routing and tracking are associated with the query group, ensuring resource quotas and task limits are maintained.

The following example query uses the `queryGroupId` to ensure that the query does not exceed that query group's resource limits:

```json
GET testindex/_search
Host: localhost:9200
Content-Type: application/json
queryGroupId: preXpc67RbKKeCyka72_Gw
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "field_name": "value"
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Workload management settings

The following settings can be used to customize workload management using the `_cluster/settings` API.

| **Setting name**  | **Description**  |
| :--- | :--- |
| `wlm.query_group.duress_streak` | Determines the node duress threshold. Once the threshold is reached, the node is marked as `in duress`. |
| `wlm.query_group.enforcement_interval`  | Defines the monitoring interval. |
| `wlm.query_group.mode`  | Defines the [operating mode](#operating-modes). |
| `wlm.query_group.node.memory_rejection_threshold` | Defines the query group level `memory` threshold. When the threshold is reached, the request is rejected. |
| `wlm.query_group.node.cpu_rejection_threshold` | Defines the query group level `cpu` threshold. When the threshold is reached, the request is rejected. |
| `wlm.query_group.node.memory_cancellation_threshold` | Controls whether the node is considered to be in duress when the `memory` threshold is reached. Requests routed to nodes in duress are canceled. |
| `wlm.query_group.node.cpu_cancellation_threshold`    | Controls whether the node is considered to be in duress when the `cpu` threshold is reached. Requests routed to nodes in duress are canceled. |

When setting rejection and cancellation thresholds, remember that the rejection threshold for a resource should always be lower than the cancellation threshold. 

## Workload Management Stats API

The Workload Management Stats API returns workload management metrics for a query group, using the following method:

```json
GET _wlm/stats
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Example response 

```json
{
  “_nodes”: {
    “total”: 1,
    “successful”: 1,
    “failed”: 0
  },

        },
        “memory”: {
