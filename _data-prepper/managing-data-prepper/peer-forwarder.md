# Peer forwarder

Peer forwarder is an HTTP service that performs peer forwarding of an `event` between Data Prepper nodes for aggregation. This HTTP service uses a hash-ring approach to aggregate events and determine which Data Prepper node it should handle on a given trace before rerouting it to that node. Currently, peer forwarder is supported by the `aggregate`, `service_map_stateful`, and `otel_trace_raw` [processors]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/data-prepper/pipelines/configuration/processors/processors/).

Peer forwarder groups events based on the identification keys provided by the supported processors. For `service_map_stateful` and `otel_trace_raw`, the identification key is `traceId` by default and cannot be configured. The `aggregate` processor is configured using the `identification_keys` configuration option. From here, you can specify which keys to use for peer forwarder. See [Aggregate Processor page](https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/tree/main/data-prepper-plugins/aggregate-processor#identification_keys) for more information about identification keys.

Peer discovery allows Data Prepper to find other nodes that it will communicate with. Currently, peer discovery is provided by a static list, a DNS record lookup, or AWS Cloud Map.  

## Discovery modes

The following sections provide information about discovery modes.

### Static

Static discovery mode allows a Data Prepper node to discover nodes using a list of IP addresses or domain names. See the following YAML file for an example of static discovery mode:

```yaml
peer_forwarder:4
  discovery_mode: static
  static_endpoints: ["data-prepper1", "data-prepper2"]
```

### DNS lookup

DNS discovery is preferred over static discovery when scaling out a Data Prepper cluster. DNS discovery configures a DNS provider to return a list of Data Prepper hosts when given a single domain name. This list consists of a [DNS A record](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-a-record/), and a list of IP addresses of a given domain. See the following YAML file for an example of DNS lookup:

```yaml
peer_forwarder:
  discovery_mode: dns
  domain_name: "data-prepper-cluster.my-domain.net"
```

### AWS Cloud Map

[AWS Cloud Map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/what-is-cloud-map.html) provides API-based service discovery as well as DNS-based service discovery.

Peer forwarder can use the API-based service discovery in AWS Cloud Map. To support this, you must have an existing namespace configured for API instance discovery. You can create a new one by following the instructions provided by the [AWS Cloud Map documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/working-with-namespaces.html).

Your Data Prepper configuration needs to include the following:
* `aws_cloud_map_namespace_name` – Set to your AWS Cloud Map namespace name.
* `aws_cloud_map_service_name` – Set to the service name within your specified namespace.
* `aws_region` – Set to the AWS Region in which your namespace exists.
* `discovery_mode` – Set to `aws_cloud_map`.

Your Data Prepper configuration can optionally include the following:
* `aws_cloud_map_query_parameters` – Key-value pairs are used to filter the results based on the custom attributes attached to an instance. Results include only those instances that match all of the specified key-value pairs.

#### Example configuration

See the following YAML file example of AWS Cloud Map configuration:

```yaml
peer_forwarder:
  discovery_mode: aws_cloud_map
  aws_cloud_map_namespace_name: "my-namespace"
  aws_cloud_map_service_name: "data-prepper-cluster"
  aws_cloud_map_query_parameters:
    instance_type: "r5.xlarge"
  aws_region: "us-east-1"
```

### IAM policy with necessary permissions

Data Prepper must also be running with the necessary permissions. The following AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy shows the necessary permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "CloudMapPeerForwarder",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "servicediscovery:DiscoverInstances",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Metrics

Core peer forwarder introduces the following custom metrics. All the metrics are prefixed by `core.peerForwarder`.

### Timer

Peer forwarder's timer capability provides the following information:

- `requestForwardingLatency`: Measures latency of requests forwarded by the peer forwarder client.
- `requestProcessingLatency`: Measures latency of requests processed by the peer forwarder server.

### Counter

The following table provides counter metric options.

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `requests`| Measures the total number of forwarded requests. |
| `requestsFailed`| Measures the total number of failed requests. Applies to requests with an HTTP response code other than `200`. |
| `requestsSuccessful`|  Measures the total number of successful requests. Applies to requests with HTTP response code `200`. |
| `requestsTooLarge`| Measures the total number of requests that are too large to be written to the peer forwarder buffer. Applies to requests with HTTP response code `413`. |
| `requestTimeouts`| Measures the total number of requests that time out while writing content to the peer forwarder buffer. Applies to requests with HTTP response code `408`. |
| `requestsUnprocessable`| Measures the total number of requests that fail due to an unprocessable entity. Applies to requests with HTTP response code `422`. |
| `badRequests`| Measures the total number of requests with a bad request format. Applies to requests with HTTP response code `400`. |
| `recordsSuccessfullyForwarded`| Measures the total number of successfully forwarded records. |

| `recordsToBeForwarded` | Measures the total number of records to be forwarded. |
| `recordsToBeProcessedLocally` | Measures the total number of records to be processed locally. |
| `recordsActuallyProcessedLocally`| Measures the total number of records actually processed locally. This value is the sum of `recordsToBeProcessedLocally` and `recordsFailedForwarding`. |
| `recordsReceivedFromPeers`| Measures the total number of records received from remote peers. |

### Gauge

`peerEndpoints` Measures the number of dynamically discovered peer Data Prepper endpoints. For `static` mode, the size is fixed.
