# Extensions

Data Prepper extensions are a way to extend Data Prepper functionality outside of pipeline components.
Many extensions provide configuration options that Data Prepper administrators can configure.

Extension configurations are available to configure in the `data-prepper-config.yaml` file.
They are configured under the `extensions:` YAML block.
