# Extensions

Data Prepper extensions Data Prepper functionality outside of core Data Prepper pipeline components.
Many extensions provide configuration options that give Data Prepper administrators greater flexibility over Data Prepper's functionality.

Extension configurations are available to configure in the `data-prepper-config.yaml` file under the `extensions:` YAML block.
