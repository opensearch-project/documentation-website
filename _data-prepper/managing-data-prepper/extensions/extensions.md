# Extensions

OpenSearch Data Prepper extensions provide OpenSearch Data Prepper functionality outside of core OpenSearch Data Prepper pipeline components.
Many extensions provide configuration options that give OpenSearch Data Prepper administrators greater flexibility over OpenSearch Data Prepper's functionality.

Extension configurations can be configured in the `data-prepper-config.yaml` file under the `extensions:` YAML block.
