# Anomaly detection

You can use Data Prepper to train models and generate anomalies in near real time on time-series aggregated events. You can generate anomalies either on events generated within the pipeline or on events coming directly into the pipeline, like OpenTelemetry metrics. You can feed these tumbling window aggregated time-series events to the [`anomaly_detector` processor]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/data-prepper/pipelines/configuration/processors/anomaly-detector/), which trains a model and generates anomalies with a grade score. Then you can configure your pipeline to write the anomalies to a separate index to create document monitors and trigger fast alerting.

## Metrics from logs 

The following pipeline receives logs from an HTTP source like FluentBit, extracts important values from the logs by matching the value in the `log` key against the [Grok Apache Common Log Format](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html#accesslog), and then forwards the grokked logs to both the `log-to-metrics-pipeline` pipeline and an OpenSearch index named `logs`.

The `log-to-metrics-pipeline` pipeline receives the grokked logs from the `apache-log-pipeline-with-metrics` pipeline, aggregates them, and derives histogram metrics based on the values in the `clientip` and `request` keys. It then sends the histogram metrics to an OpenSearch index named `histogram_metrics` as well as to the `log-to-metrics-anomaly-detector-pipeline` pipeline.

The `log-to-metrics-anomaly-detector-pipeline` pipeline receives the aggregated histogram metrics from the `log-to-metrics-pipeline` pipeline and sends them to the `anomaly_detector` processor to detect anomalies by using the Random Cut Forest algorithm. If the algorithm detects anomalies, it sends them to an OpenSearch index named `log-metric-anomalies`.

## Metrics from traces

You can derive metrics from traces and find anomalies in those metrics. In this example, the `entry-pipeline` pipeline receives trace data from the OpenTelemetry Collector and forwards it to the following pipelines:

- `span-pipeline` –- Extracts the raw spans from the traces. The pipeline sends the raw spans to any indexes OpenSearch prefixed with `otel-v1-apm-span`.

- `service-map-pipeline` –- Aggregates and analyzes the traces to create documents that represent connections between services. The pipeline sends these documents to an OpenSearch index named `otel-v1-apm-service-map`. You can then see a visualization of the service map through the [Trace Analytics]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/trace/index/) plugin for OpenSearch Dashboards.

- `trace-to-metrics-pipeline` -- Aggregates and derives histogram metrics from the traces based on the value of the `serviceName`. The pipeline then sends the derived metrics to an OpenSearch index named `metrics_for_traces` and to the `trace-to-metrics-anomaly-detector-pipeline` pipeline.

The `trace-to-metrics-anomaly-detector-pipeline` pipeline receives the aggregated histogram metrics from the `trace-to-metrics-pipeline` and sends them to the `anomaly_detector` processor to detect anomalies by using the Random Cut Forest algorithm. If the algorithm detects any anomalies, it sends them to an OpenSearch index named `trace-metric-anomalies`.

## OpenTelemetry metrics

You can create a pipeline that receives OpenTelemetry metrics and detects anomalies in those metrics. In this example, `entry-pipeline` receives metrics from the OpenTelemetry Collector. If a metric is of type `GAUGE` and the name of the metric is `totalApiBytesSent`, the processor sends it to the `ad-pipeline` pipeline.

The `ad-pipeline` pipeline receives the metrics from the entry pipeline and performs anomaly detection on the metric values by using the [`anomaly_detector` processor]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/data-prepper/pipelines/configuration/processors/anomaly-detector/).

```json
entry-pipeline:
  source:
    otel_metrics_source:
  processor:
    - otel_metrics:
  route:
    - gauge_route: '/kind = "GAUGE" and /name = "totalApiBytesSent"'
  sink:
    - pipeline:
        name: "ad-pipeline"
        routes:
          - gauge_route
    - opensearch:
        ...
        index: "otel-metrics"

ad-pipeline:
  source:
    pipeline:
      name: "entry-pipeline"
    processor:
      - anomaly_detector:
        # Use "value" as the key on which anomaly detector needs to be run
        keys: [ "value" ]
        mode:
          random_cut_forest:
    sink:
      - opensearch:
        ...
        index: otel-metrics-anomalies                     
```
