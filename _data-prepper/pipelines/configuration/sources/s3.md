# s3

## Overview

This is a source plugin that reads events from [Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Amazon S3) objects.

Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
notification_type | Yes | String | Must be `sqs`
compression | No | String | The compression algorithm to apply: `none`, `gzip`, or `automatic`. Default is `none`.
codec | Yes | Codec | The codec to apply. Must be `newline`, `json`, or `csv`.
sqs | Yes | sqs | The [Amazon Simple Queue Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) (Amazon SQS) configuration. See [sqs](#sqs) for details.
aws | Yes | aws | The AWS configuration. See [aws](#aws) for details.
on_error | No | String |  Determines how to handle errors in Amazon SQS. Can be either `retain_messages` or `delete_messages`. If `retain_messages`, then Data Prepper will leave the message in the SQS queue and try again. This is recommended for dead-letter queues. If `delete_messages`, then Data Prepper will delete failed messages. Default is `retain_messages`.
buffer_timeout | No | Duration | The timeout for writing events to the Data Prepper buffer. Any events that the S3Source cannot write to the buffer in this time will be discarded. Default is 10 seconds.
records_to_accumulate | No | Integer | The number of messages that accumulate before writing to the buffer. Default is 100.
metadata_root_key | No | String | Base key for adding S3 metadata to each Event. The metadata includes the key and bucket for each S3 object. Defaults to `s3/`.
disable_bucket_ownership_validation | No | Boolean | If `true`, the S3Source will not attempt to validate that the bucket is owned by the expected account. The expected account is the same account that owns the SQS queue. Defaults to `false`.

wait_time | No | Duration | The time to wait for long polling on the SQS API. Default is `20s`.
