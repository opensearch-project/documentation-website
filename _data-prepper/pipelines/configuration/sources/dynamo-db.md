# dynamodb

The `dynamodb` source enables change data capture (CDC) on [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) tables. It can receive table events, such as `create`, `update`, or `delete`, using DynamoDB streams and supports initial snapshots using [point-in-time recovery (PITR)](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pitr/).

The source includes two ingestion options to stream DynamoDB events:

1. A _full initial snapshot_ using [PITR](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pitr/) gets an initial snapshot of the current state of the DynamoDB table. This requires the PITR Snapshots and DyanmoDB option enabled on your DynamoDB table.
2.  Stream events from DynamoDB streams without full initial snapshots. This is useful if you already have a snapshot mechanism within your pipelines. This requires that the DynamoDB stream option is enabled on the DynamoDB table.

## Usage

The following example pipeline specifies DynamoDB as a source. It ingests data from a DyanmoDB table named `table-a` through a PITR snapshot. It also indicates the `start_position`, which tells the pipeline how to read DynamoDB stream events:

```yaml
version: "2"
cdc-pipeline:
  source:
    dynamodb:
      tables:
        - table_arn: "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/table-a"
          export:
            s3_bucket: "test-bucket"
            s3_prefix: "myprefix"
          stream:
            start_position: "LATEST" # Read latest data from streams (Default)
            view_on_remove: NEW_IMAGE
      aws:
        region: "us-west-2"
        sts_role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-iam-role"
```

## Configuration options

The following tables describe the configuration options for the `dynamodb` source.

Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
`aws` | Yes | AWS | The AWS configuration. See [aws](#aws) for more information.
`acknowledgments` | No | Boolean  | When `true`, enables `s3` sources to receive [end-to-end acknowledgments]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/data-prepper/pipelines/pipelines#end-to-end-acknowledgments) when events are received by OpenSearch sinks.
`shared_acknowledgement_timeout` | No | Duration | The amount of time that elapses before the data read from a DynamoDB stream expires when used with acknowledgements. Default is 10 minutes.
`s3_data_file_acknowledgment_timeout` | No | Duration | The amount of time that elapses before the data read from a DynamoDB export expires when used with acknowledgments. Default is 5 minutes.
`tables` | Yes | List | The configuration for the DynamoDB table. See [tables](#tables) for more information.

### aws

Use the following options in the AWS configuration.

Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
`region` | No | String | The AWS Region to use for credentials. Defaults to [standard SDK behavior to determine the Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/region-selection.html).
`sts_role_arn` | No | String | The AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) role to assume for requests to Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Defaults to `null`, which will use the [standard SDK behavior for credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html).
`aws_sts_header_overrides` | No | Map | A map of header overrides that the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role assumes for the sink plugin.


### tables

Use the following options with the `tables` configuration.

Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
`table_arn` | Yes | String | The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source DynamoDB table.
`export` | No | Export | Determines how to export DynamoDB events. For more information, see [export](#export-options).
`stream` | No | Stream | Determines how the pipeline reads data from the DynamoDB table. For more information, see [stream](#stream-option).

#### Export options

The following options let you customize the export destination for DynamoDB events.

Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
`s3_bucket` | Yes | String | The destination bucket that stores the exported data files.
`s3_prefix` | No | String | The custom prefix for the S3 bucket.
`s3_sse_kms_key_id` | No | String |  An AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that encrypts the export data files. The `key_id` is the ARN of the KMS key, for example, `arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/0a4bc22f-bb96-4ad4-80ca-63b12b3ec147`.
`s3_region` | No | String | The Region for the S3 bucket.

#### Stream option

The following option lets you customize how the pipeline reads events from the DynamoDB table.

Option | Required | Type   | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
`start_position` | No | String | The position from where the source starts reading stream events when the DynamoDB stream option is enabled. `LATEST` starts reading events from the most recent stream record. 
`view_on_remove` | No | Enum | The [stream record view](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html) to use for REMOVE events from DynamoDB streams. Must be either `NEW_IMAGE` or `OLD_IMAGE` . Defaults to `NEW_IMAGE`. If the `OLD_IMAGE` option is used and the old image can not be found, the source will find the `NEW_IMAGE`.

## Exposed metadata attributes

The following metadata will be added to each event that is processed by the `dynamodb` source. These metadata attributes can be accessed using the [expression syntax `getMetadata` function](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/data-prepper/pipelines/expression-syntax/#getmetadata).

* `primary_key`: The primary key of the DynamoDB item. For tables that only contain a partition key, this value provides the partition key. For tables that contain both a partition and sort key, the `primary_key` attribute will be equal to the partition and sort key, separated by a `|`, for example, `partition_key|sort_key`.
* `partition_key`: The partition key of the DynamoDB item.
* `sort_key`: The sort key of the DynamoDB item. This will be null if the table does not contain a sort key.
* `dynamodb_timestamp`: The timestamp of the DynamoDB item. This will be the export time for export items and the DynamoDB stream event time for stream items. This timestamp is used by sinks to emit an `EndtoEndLatency` metric for DynamoDB stream events that tracks the latency between a change occurring in the DynamoDB table and that change being applied to the sink.
* `document_version`: Uses the `dynamodb_timestamp` to modify break ties between stream items that are received in the same second. Recommend for use with the `opensearch` sink's `document_version` setting.
* `opensearch_action`: A default value for mapping DynamoDB event actions to OpenSearch actions. This action will be `index` for export items, and `INSERT` or `MODIFY` for stream events, and `REMOVE` stream events when the OpenSearch action is `delete`.
* `dynamodb_event_name`: The exact event type for the item. Will be `null` for export items and either `INSERT`, `MODIFY`, or `REMOVE` for stream events.
* `table_name`: The name of the DynamoDB table that an event came from.

            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "allowReadAndWriteToS3ForExport",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",

                "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

When performing an export, the `"Sid": "allowReadFromStream"` section is not required. If only reading from DynamoDB streams, the 
`"Sid": "allowReadAndWriteToS3ForExport"`, `"Sid": "allowCheckExportjob"`, and ` "Sid": "allowRunExportJob"` sections are not required.

## Metrics

The `dynamodb` source includes the following metrics.

### Counters

* `exportJobSuccess`: The number of export jobs that have been submitted successfully.
* `exportJobFailure`: The number of export job submission attempts that have failed.
* `exportS3ObjectsTotal`: The total number of export data files found in S3.
* `exportS3ObjectsProcessed`: The total number of export data files that have been processed successfully from S3.
* `exportRecordsTotal`: The total number of records found in the export.
* `exportRecordsProcessed`: The total number of export records that have been processed successfully.
* `exportRecordsProcessingErrors`: The number of export record processing errors.
* `changeEventsProcessed`: The number of change events processed from DynamoDB streams.
* `changeEventsProcessingErrors`: The number of processing errors for change events from DynamoDB streams.
* `shardProgress`: The incremented shard progress when DynamoDB streams are being read correctly. This being`0` for any significant amount of time means there is a problem with the pipeline that has streams enabled.
