# Processors

Processors perform an action on your data, such as filtering, transforming, or enriching.

Prior to Data Prepper 1.3, processors were named preppers. Starting in Data Prepper 1.3, the term *prepper* is deprecated in favor of the term *processor*. Data Prepper will continue to support the term *prepper* until 2.0, where it will be removed.
