# Processors

Processors perform an action on your data, such as filtering, transforming, or enriching.

Prior to Data Prepper 1.3, processors were named preppers. Starting in Data Prepper 1.3, the term _prepper_ is deprecated in favor of the term _processor_. Data Prepper will continue to support the term _prepper_ until 2.0, where it will be removed.
