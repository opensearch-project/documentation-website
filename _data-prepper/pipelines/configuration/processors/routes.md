# Routes

## Overview

Routes define conditions that can be used in sinks for conditional routing. Routes are specified at the same level as processors and sinks under the name `route` and consist of a list of key-value pairs, where the key is the name of a route and the value is a Data Prepper expression representing the routing condition.
