Option | Description | Example
:--- | :--- | :---
source | Mandatory field that specifies the name of the field in the event containing the message or object to be parsed. | If `source` is set to `"message"` and the input is `{"message": {"key1":"value1", "key2":{"key3":"value3"}}}`, then the `write_json` processor outputs the event as `"{\"key1\":\"value1\",\"key2\":{\"key3\":\"value3\"}}"`.
target | An optional field that specifies the name of the field in which the resulting JSON string should be stored. If `target` is not specified, then the `source` field is used. | `key1`
