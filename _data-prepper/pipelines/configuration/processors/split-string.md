Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
entries | Yes | List | List of entries. Valid values are `source`, `delimiter`, and `delimiter_regex`.
source | N/A | N/A | The key to split.
delimiter | No | N/A | The separator character responsible for the split. Cannot be defined at the same time as `delimiter_regex`. At least `delimiter` or `delimiter_regex` must be defined.
delimiter_regex | No | N/A | The regex string responsible for the split. Cannot be defined at the same time as `delimiter`. At least `delimiter` or `delimiter_regex` must be defined.

### Usage

To get started, create the following `pipeline.yaml` file:

```yaml
pipeline:
  source:
    file:
      path: "/full/path/to/logs_json.log"
      record_type: "event"
      format: "json"
  processor:
    - split_string:
        entries:
          - source: "message"
            delimiter: ","
  sink:
    - stdout:
```
{% include copy.html %}

Next, create a log file named `logs_json.log`. After that, replace the `path` in the file source of your `pipeline.yaml` file with your file path. For more detailed information, see [Configuring OpenSearch Data Prepper]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/data-prepper/getting-started/#2-configuring-data-prepper). 

Before you run Data Prepper, the source appears in the following format:

```json
{"message": "hello,world"}
```
After you run Data Prepper, the source is converted to the following format:

```json
{"message":["hello","world"]}
```
