# Service map processor

The `service_map` processor uses OpenTelemetry data to create a distributed service map for visualization in OpenSearch Dashboards.

This service_map processor generates static service map and doesn't reflect the changes in the topology with time. The new `otel_apm_service_map` processor provides time based service map.

## Configuration

The following table describes the option you can use to configure the `service_map` processor.

- name: service_map
- pluginType: processor
- source: https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/blob/c4455a7785bc2da4358067c217be7085e0bc8d0f/data-prepper-plugins/service-map-stateful/src/main/java/org/opensearch/dataprepper/plugins/processor/ServiceMapProcessorConfig.java

Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
window_duration | No | Integer | Represents the fixed time window, in seconds, during which service map relationships are evaluated. Default value is 180.

## Metrics

The following table describes common [Abstract processor](https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/blob/main/data-prepper-api/src/main/java/org/opensearch/dataprepper/model/processor/AbstractProcessor.java) metrics.

| Metric name | Type | Description |
| ------------- | ---- | -----------|
| `recordsIn` | Counter | Metric representing the ingress of records to a pipeline component. |
| `recordsOut` | Counter | Metric representing the egress of records from a pipeline component. |
| `timeElapsed` | Timer | Metric representing the time elapsed during execution of a pipeline component. |

The `service_map` processor includes following custom metrics:

* `spansDbSize`:  Total size in bytes of both current and previous span database windows
* `spansDbCount`: Total count of span entries across both current and previous span database windows
* `traceGroupDbSize`: Total size in bytes of both current and previous trace group database windows
* `traceGroupDbCount`: Total count of trace group entries across both current and previous trace group database windows
* `relationshipCount`: Total number of unique service map relationships discovered and stored in the relationship state
