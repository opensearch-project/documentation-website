* `endTime`: end time of the entire trace in ISO 8601
* `durationInNanos`: duration of the entire trace in nanoseconds
* `statusCode`: status code for the entire trace in nanoseconds

in all incoming Data Prepper span records by state caching the root span info per traceId. 

Option | Required | Type | Description
