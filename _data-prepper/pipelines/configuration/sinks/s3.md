# s3

The `s3` sink sends records to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket using the S3 client.

## Usage

The following example creates a pipeline configured with an s3 sink. It contains additional options for customizing the event and size thresholds for which the pipeline sends record events and sets the codec type `ndjson`:

```
pipeline:
  ...
  sink:
    - s3:
        aws:
          region: us-east-1
          sts_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/Data-Prepper
          sts_header_overrides:
        max_retries: 5
        bucket:
          name: bucket_name
          object_key:
            path_prefix: my-elb/%{yyyy}/%{MM}/%{dd}/
        threshold:
          event_count: 2000
          maximum_size: 50mb
          event_collect_timeout: 15s
        codec:
          ndjson:
        buffer_type: in_memory
```

## Configuration 

Use the following options when customizing the `s3` sink.

Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
`bucket` | Yes | String | The object from which the data is retrieved and then stored. The `name` must match the name of your object store.
`region` | No | String | The AWS Region to use when connecting to S3. Defaults to the [standard SDK behavior to determine the Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/region-selection.html).
`sts_role_arn` | No | String | The [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html) (AWS STS) role that the `s3` sink assumes when sending a request to S3. Defaults to the [standard SDK behavior for credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html). 
`sts_external_id` | No | String | The external ID to attach to AssumeRole requests from AWS STS.
`max_retries` | No | Integer | The maximum number of times a single request should retry when ingesting data to S3. Defaults to `5`.
`object_key` | No | Sets the `path_prefix` and the `file_pattern` of the object store. Defaults to the S3 object `events-%{yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh-mm-ss}` found inside the root directory of the bucket.

## Threshold configuration options

Use the following options to set ingestion thresholds for the `s3` sink.

Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
`event_count` | Yes | Integer | The maximum number of events the S3 bucket can ingest. 
`maximum_size` | Yes | String | The maximum count or number of bytes that the S3 bucket can ingest. Defaults to `50mb`.
`event_collect_timeout` | Yes | String | Sets the time period during which events are collected before ingestion. All values are strings that represent duration, either an ISO_8601 notation string, such as `PT20.345S`, or a simple notation, such as `60s` or `1500ms`.

## buffer_type

`buffer_type` is an optional configuration that records stored events temporarily before flushing them into an S3 bucket. Use of one of the following options: 

- `local_file`: Flushes the record into a file on your machine. 
<<<<<<< HEAD
- `in_memory`: Stores the record in memory.
=======
- `multipart`: Writes using the [S3 multipart upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html). Every 10 MB is written as a part.

## Object key configuration

Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
`path_prefix` | Yes | String | The S3 key prefix path to use. Accepts date-time formatting. For example, you can use `%{yyyy}/%{MM}/%{dd}/%{HH}/` to create hourly folders in S3. By default, events write to the root of the bucket. 


## codec

The `codec` determines how the `s3` source formats data written to each S3 object.

### avro codec

The `avro` codec writes an event as an [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) document.

Because Avro requires a schema, you may either define the schema yourself, or Data Prepper will automatically generate a schema.
In general, you should define your own schema because it will most accurately reflect your needs.
In cases where your data is uniform, you may be able to automatically generate a schema.
Automatically generated schemas are based on the first event received by the codec.
The schema will only contain keys from this event. Therefore, you must have all keys present in all events in order for the automatically generated schema to produce a working schema.
Automatically generated schemas make all fields nullable.


Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
`schema` | Yes | String | The Avro [schema declaration](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/#schema-declaration). Not required if `auto_schema` is set to true.
`auto_schema` | No | Boolean | When set to `true`, automatically generates the Avro [schema declaration](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/#schema-declaration) from the first event.

 
### ndjson codec

The `ndjson` codec writes each line as a JSON object.

The `ndjson` codec does not take any configurations.


### json codec

The `json` codec writes events in a single large JSON file.
Each event is written into an object within a JSON array.


Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
`key_name` | No | String | The name of the key for the JSON array. By default this is `events`.


### parquet codec

The `parquet` codec writes events into a Parquet file.
You must set the `buffer_type` to `multipart` when using Parquet.

The Parquet codec writes data using the Avro schema.
In general, you should define your own schema because it will most accurately reflect your needs.
In cases where your data is uniform, you may be able to automatically generate a schema.
Automatically generated schemas are based on the first event received by the codec.
The schema will only have keys from this event, so you must have all keys present in all events for the auto-schema generation to produce a working schema.
Auto-generated schemas make all fields nullable.


Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
`schema` | Yes | String | The Avro [schema declaration](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/#schema-declaration). Not required if `auto_schema` is set to true.
`auto_schema` | No | Boolean | When set to `true`, automatically generates the Avro [schema declaration](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/#schema-declaration) from the first event.
