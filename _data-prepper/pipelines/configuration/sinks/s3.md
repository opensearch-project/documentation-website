# s3

The `s3` sink sends records to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket using the S3 client.

## Usage

The following example creates a pipeline configured with an s3 sink. It contains additional options for customizing the event and size thresholds for which the pipeline sends record events and sets the codec type `ndjson`:

```
pipeline:
  ...
  sink:
    - s3:
        aws:
          region: us-east-1
          sts_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/Data-Prepper
          sts_header_overrides:
        max_retries: 5
        bucket:
          name: bucket_name
          object_key:
            path_prefix: my-elb/%{yyyy}/%{MM}/%{dd}/
        threshold:
          event_count: 2000
          maximum_size: 50mb
          event_collect_timeout: 15s
        codec:
          ndjson:
        buffer_type: in_memory
```

## Configuration 

Use the following options when customizing the `s3` sink.

Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
`bucket` | Yes | String | The object from which the data is retrieved and then stored. The `name` must match the name of your object store.
`region` | No | String | The AWS Region to use when connecting to S3. Defaults to the [standard SDK behavior to determine the Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/region-selection.html).
`sts_role_arn` | No | String | The [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html) (AWS STS) role that the `s3` sink assumes when sending a request to S3. Defaults to the [standard SDK behavior for credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html). 
`sts_external_id` | No | String | The external ID to attach to AssumeRole requests from AWS STS.
`max_retries` | No | Integer | The maximum number of times a single request should retry when ingesting data to S3. Defaults to `5`.
`object_key` | No | Sets the `path_prefix` and the `file_pattern` of the object store. Defaults to the S3 object `events-%{yyyy-MM-dd'T'hh-mm-ss}` found inside the root directory of the bucket.

## Threshold configuration options

Use the following options to set ingestion thresholds for the `s3` sink.

Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
`event_count` | Yes | Integer | The maximum number of events the S3 bucket can ingest. 
`maximum_size` | Yes | String | The maximum count or number of bytes that the S3 bucket can ingest. Defaults to `50mb`.
`event_collect_timeout` | Yes | String | Sets the time period during which events are collected before ingestion. All values are strings that represent duration, either an ISO_8601 notation string, such as `PT20.345S`, or a simple notation, such as `60s` or `1500ms`.

## buffer_type

`buffer_type` is an optional configuration that records stored events temporarily before flushing them into an S3 bucket. Use of one of the following options: 

- `local_file`: Flushes the record into a file on your machine. 
- `in_memory`: Stores the record in memory.
