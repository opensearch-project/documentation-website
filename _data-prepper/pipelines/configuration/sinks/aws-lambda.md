# `aws_lambda` sink for Data Prepper

This page explains how to configure and use [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) with Data Prepper, enabling Lambda functions to serve as both processors and sinks.

## `aws_lambda` sink

Configure the Lambda sink using the following parameters.

Field             | Type    | Required | Description                                                                 
--------------------| ------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
`function_name`     | String  | Yes      | The name of the AWS Lambda function to invoke.                               
`invocation_type`   | String  | No       | Specifies the invocation type. Default is `event`.             
`aws.region`        | String  | Yes      | The AWS Region in which the Lambda function is located.                         
`aws.sts_role_arn`  | String  | No       | The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume before invoking the Lambda function.               
`max_retries`       | Integer | No       | The maximum number of retries if the invocation fails. Default is `3`.             
`batch`             | Object  | No       | Optional batch settings for Lambda invocations. Default is `key_name = events`. Default threshold is `event_count=100`, `maximum_size="5mb"`, and `event_collect_timeout = 10s`.
`lambda_when`       | String  | No       | A conditional expression that determines when to invoke the Lambda sink.          
`dlq`               | Object  | No       | The dead-letter queue (DLQ) configuration for failed invocations.                

#### Example configuration

```
sink:
  - aws_lambda:
      function_name: "my-lambda-sink"
      invocation_type: "event"
      aws:
        region: "us-west-2"
        sts_role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-lambda-sink-role"
      max_retries: 5
      batch:
        key_name: "events"
        threshold:
          event_count: 50
          maximum_size: "3mb"
          event_collect_timeout: PT5S
      lambda_when: "event['type'] == 'log'"
      dlq:
        region: "us-east-1"
        sts_role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-sqs-role"
        bucket: "<<your-dlq-bucket-name>>"
```

## Usage

The invocation types are as follows:

- `event` (Default): Executes functions asynchronously without waiting for responses.  
- `request-response` (Sink only): Executes functions synchronously, though responses are not processed.
- `batch`: Automatically groups events based on configured thresholds. 
- `dlq`: Supports the DLQ configuration for failed invocations after retry attempts.

Data Prepper components use an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role assumption, `aws.sts_role_arn`, for secure Lambda function invocation and respect Lambda's concurrency limits during event processing. For more information, see the [AWS Lambda documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda).

## Developer guide

Integration tests must be executed separately from the main Data Prepper build. Execute them with the following command:

```
./gradlew :data-prepper-plugins:aws-lambda:integrationTest -Dtests.sink.lambda.region="us-east-1" -Dtests.sink.lambda.functionName="lambda_test_function"  -Dtests.sink.lambda.sts_role_arn="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/dataprepper-role
```
