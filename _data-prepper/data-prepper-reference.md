### csv

Takes in an Event and parses its CSV data into columns.

Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
source | No | String | The field in the Event that will be parsed. Default is `message`.
quote_character | No | String | The character used as a text qualifier for a single column of data. Default is double quote `"`.
delimiter | No | String | The character separating each column. Default is `,`.
delete_header | No | Boolean | If specified, the header on the Event (`column_names_source_key`) deletes after the Event is parsed. If there’s no header on the Event, no actions is taken. Default is true.
column_names_source_key | No | String | The field in the Event that specifies the CSV column names, which will be autodetected. If there must be extra column names, the column names autogenerate according to their index. If `column_names` is also defined, the header in `column_names_source_key` can also be used to generate the Event fields. If too few columns are specified in this field, the remaining column names autogenerate. If too many column names are specified in this field, CSV processor omits the extra column names.
column_names | No | List | User-specified names for the CSV columns. Default is `[column1, column2, ..., columnN]` if there are N columns of data in the CSV record and `column_names_source_key` is not defined. If `column_names_source_key` is defined, the header in `column_names_source_key` generates the Event fields. If too few columns are specified in this field, the remaining column names will autogenerate. If too many column names are specified in this field, CSV processor omits the extra column names.

### json

Takes in an Event and parses its JSON data, including any nested fields.

Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
source | No | String | The field in the `Event` that will be parsed. Default is `message`.
destination | No | String | The destination field of the parsed JSON. Defaults to the root of the `Event`. Cannot be `""`, `/`, or any whitespace-only `String` because these are not valid `Event` fields.
pointer | No | String | A JSON Pointer to the field to be parsed. There is no `pointer` by default, meaning the entire `source` is parsed. The `pointer` can access JSON Array indices as well. If the JSON Pointer is invalid then the entire `source` data is parsed into the outgoing `Event`. If the pointed-to key already exists in the `Event` and the `destination` is the root, then the pointer uses the entire path of the key.


## Routes

Routes define conditions that can be used in sinks for conditional routing. Routes are specified at the same level as processors and sinks under the name `route` and consist of a list of key-value pairs, where the key is the name of a route and the value is a Data Prepper expression representing the routing condition.


## Sinks

Sinks define where Data Prepper writes your data to.

### General options for all sink types

Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
routes | No | List | List of routes that the sink accepts. If not specified, the sink accepts all upstream events.


### opensearch

Sink for an OpenSearch cluster.

Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
hosts | Yes | List | List of OpenSearch hosts to write to (e.g. `["https://localhost:9200", "https://remote-cluster:9200"]`).
cert | No | String | Path to the security certificate (e.g. `"config/root-ca.pem"`) if the cluster uses the OpenSearch security plugin.
username | No | String | Username for HTTP basic authentication.
password | No | String | Password for HTTP basic authentication.
aws_sigv4 | No | Boolean | default false. Whether to use IAM signing to connect to an Amazon OpenSearch Service domain. For your access key, secret key, and optional session token, Data Prepper uses the default credential chain (environment variables, Java system properties, `~/.aws/credential`, etc.).
aws_region | No | String | AWS region (e.g. `"us-east-1"`) for the domain if you are connecting to Amazon OpenSearch Service.
aws_sts_role_arn | No | String | IAM role which the sink plugin assumes to sign request to Amazon OpenSearch Service. If not provided the plugin uses the default credentials.
socket_timeout | No | Integer | the timeout in milliseconds for waiting for data (or, put differently, a maximum period inactivity between two consecutive data packets). A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. If this timeout value is either negative or not set, the underlying Apache HttpClient would rely on operating system settings for managing socket timeouts.
connect_timeout | No | Integer | The timeout in milliseconds used when requesting a connection from the connection manager. A timeout value of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. If this timeout value is either negative or not set, the underlying Apache HttpClient would rely on operating system settings for managing connection timeouts.
insecure | No | Boolean | Whether to verify SSL certificates. If set to true, CA certificate verification is disabled and insecure HTTP requests are sent instead. Default is `false`.
proxy | No | String | The address of a [forward HTTP proxy server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server). The format is "&lt;host name or IP&gt;:&lt;port&gt;". Examples: "example.com:8100", "http://example.com:8100", "112.112.112.112:8100". Port number cannot be omitted.
index | Conditionally | String | Name of the export index. Applicable and required only when the `index_type` is `custom`.
index_type | No | String | This index type tells the Sink plugin what type of data it is handling. Valid values: `custom`, `trace-analytics-raw`, `trace-analytics-service-map`, `management-disabled`. Default is `custom`.
template_file | No | String | Path to a JSON [index template]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/index-templates/) file (e.g. `/your/local/template-file.json`) if `index_type` is `custom`. See [otel-v1-apm-span-index-template.json](https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/blob/main/data-prepper-plugins/opensearch/src/main/resources/otel-v1-apm-span-index-template.json) for an example.
document_id_field | No | String | The field from the source data to use for the OpenSearch document ID (e.g. `"my-field"`) if `index_type` is `custom`.
dlq_file | No | String | The path to your preferred dead letter queue file (e.g. `/your/local/dlq-file`). Data Prepper writes to this file when it fails to index a document on the OpenSearch cluster.
bulk_size | No | Integer (long) | The maximum size (in MiB) of bulk requests to the OpenSearch cluster. Values below 0 indicate an unlimited size. If a single document exceeds the maximum bulk request size, Data Prepper sends it individually. Default is 5.
ism_policy_file | No | String | The absolute file path for an ISM (Index State Management) policy JSON file. This policy file is effective only when there is no built-in policy file for the index type. For example, `custom` index type is currently the only one without a built-in policy file, thus it would use the policy file here if it's provided through this parameter. For more information, see [ISM policies]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/im-plugin/ism/policies/).
number_of_shards | No | Integer | The number of primary shards that an index should have on the destination OpenSearch server. This parameter is effective only when `template_file` is either explicitly provided in Sink configuration or built-in. If this parameter is set, it would override the value in index template file. For more information, see [Create index]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/index-apis/create-index/).
number_of_replicas | No | Integer | The number of replica shards each primary shard should have on the destination OpenSearch server. For example, if you have 4 primary shards and set number_of_replicas to 3, the index has 12 replica shards. This parameter is effective only when `template_file` is either explicitly provided in Sink configuration or built-in. If this parameter is set, it would override the value in index template file. For more information, see [Create index]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/index-apis/create-index/).
