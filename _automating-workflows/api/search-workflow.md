# Search for a workflow

This is an experimental feature and is not recommended for use in a production environment. For updates on the progress of the feature or if you want to leave feedback, see the associated [GitHub issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/flow-framework/issues/475).

You can retrieve created workflows with their `workflow_id` or search for workflows by using a query matching a field. You can use the `use_case` field to search for similar workflows.
