# Using VisBuilder

You can use the VisBuilder visualization type in OpenSearch Dashboards to create data visualizations by using a drag-and-drop gesture. With VisBuilder you have:

* An immediate view of your data without the need to preselect the visualization output.
* The flexibility to change visualization types and index patterns quickly.
* The ability to easily navigate between multiple screens.

## Try VisBuilder in the OpenSearch Dashboards playground

If you'd like to try out VisBuilder without installing OpenSearch locally, you can do so in the [Dashboards playground](https://playground.opensearch.org/app/vis-builder#/).
