# Region map visualizations

OpenSearch Dashboards provides basic map tiles with a standard vector map that you use to create visualizations. OpenSearch also provides a standard set of GeoJSON files to provide a vector map with your regional maps.

## Custom vector maps with Geo JSON

You can also create your own custom vector map by uploading a Geo JSON file that contains data for your customized regional maps. The JSON file contains vector layers for visualization.

1. Open OpenSearch Dashboards at `https://<host>:<port>`. For example, [https://localhost:5601](https://localhost:5601).
1. If necessary, log in.
1. Choose **Visualizations**, and **Create Visualization**.
1. Select **Region Map**.
1. Choose a source to upload your JSON file.
1. Choose a source, for example: \**[Flights] Flight Log**.
1. Select **Import Vector Map**. Upload your .json file and give a name for the custom map.

## Layer options

If you upload a custom Geo JSON file, you can toggle between the layer options: Default vector map or Custom vector map.

1. Open OpenSearch Dashboards at `https://<host>:<port>`. For example, [https://localhost:5601](https://localhost:5601).
1. If necessary, log in.
1. Choose **Visualizations**, and **Create Visualization**.
