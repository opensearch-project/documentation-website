# Wait for Completion in Dashboards
Introduced 2.7
{: .label .label-purple }

The index management plugin will provide a notification config for these long running operations, which can provide notification through Chime, Webhook, and Slack by using some capability of the notification plugin. There will be some new CRUD APIs to manage these configs.

** Screenshots and config below:

`wait_for_completion` parameter [API reference]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/wait_for_completion/).
