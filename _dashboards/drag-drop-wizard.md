# Build visualizations by dragging and dropping fields

You can use the drag and drop visualization wizard in OpenSearch Dashboards to create your data visualizations easily with just a few clicks or a single mouse gesture. 

The drag and drop visualization wizard:

* Gives you an immediate view of your data without the need to preselect the visualization output 
* Gives you the flexibility to change visualization types and index patterns on the fly
* Gives you the ability to easily navigate between multiple screens

Beginning with OpenSearch release 1.3, the drag and drop wizard is available as an experimental feature. We invite you to try the wizard and let us know how you feel about it. Experimental features may change, break, or disappear at any time and shouldn’t be enabled in production environments.

# Try out the drag and drop wizard in the playground or create a new visualization wizard

You can explore the drag and drop wizard directly from the [OpenSearch Wizard playground](https://playground.opensearch.org/app/wizard), or you can create a new visualization and select wizard. 

The following steps walk you through creating a new visualization using the wizard:

1. Open [OpenSearch Dashboards playground](https://playground.opensearch.org/app/home#/).
2. Under the menu icon, select **Visualize** **>** **Create visualization** **>** **Wizard**.

3. Use sample data to add fields and generate a visualization.

Here’s an example visualization. Your visualization will look different depending on the sample data you select.
