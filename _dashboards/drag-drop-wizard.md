# Drag and drop wizard

You can use the drag and drop visualization wizard in OpenSearch Dashboards to create your data visualizations easily with just a few clicks or a single mouse gesture. 

The drag and drop visualization wizard:

* Gives you an immediate view of your data without the need to preselect the visualization output 
* Gives you the flexibility to change visualization types and index patterns on the fly
