The drag-and-drop visualization wizard is an experimental feature in OpenSearch 2.3. Therefore, we do not recommend the use of the drag-and-drop wizard in a production environment. For updates on the progress of drag and drop, or if you want to leave feedback that could help improve the feature, see the [Drag and drop git issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/issues/2280).

# Drag-and-drop wizard

You can use the drag-and-drop visualization wizard in OpenSearch Dashboards to create your data visualizations easily with just a few clicks or a single mouse gesture. 

The drag-and-drop visualization wizard:

* Gives you an immediate view of your data without the need to preselect the visualization output. 
* Gives you the flexibility to change visualization types and index patterns quickly.
* Gives you the ability to easily navigate between multiple screens.

## Try out the wizard

You can try out the wizard locally or in the [OpenSearch playground](https://playground.opensearch.org/app/home#/).

### Try the wizard in OpenSearch playground

If you'd like to try out the wizard without installing OpenSearch locally, you can do so in the [OpenSearch Dashboards playground](https://playground.opensearch.org/app/wizard). The feature is enabled in the playground by default. 

### Try the wizard locally

To enable the drag-and-drop wizard in your local installation, add the following flag to the `opensearch_dashboards.yml` file:

```yml
wizard.enabled: true
```

Then confirm that the feature is enabled in OpenSearch Dashboards:

1. To open OpenSearch Dashboards:
    - If you're not running the security plugin, go to http://localhost:5601. 
    - If you're running the security plugin, go to https://localhost:5601 and log in with your username and password (default is admin/admin).

2. From the top menu, select **Management** **>** **Stack Management** **>** **Advanced Settings**.
