# Setting the time filter

You can change the time range to display dashboard data over minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years.

The default time range is **Last 15 minutes**. You can change the time range at the dashboard level or under **Stack Management > Advanced Settings > Time filter defaults**.

   - **Recently used date ranges:** Select a previously used time range.
   - **Refresh every:** Set an automatic refresh period.
