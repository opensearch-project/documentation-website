# Analyzing data

You can analyze your data in OpenSearch and visualize key metrics using the **Discover** application in OpenSearch Dashboards. Using **Discover**, you can explore and visualize data from various data sources, data types, and query languages.

## Getting started

Before getting started with exploring and visualizing your data using **Discover**, make sure you:

- Install [OpenSearch Dashboards](https://opensearch.org/downloads.html).
- Add sample data or import your own data into OpenSearch. See [OpenSearch Dashboards quickstart guide]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/dashboards/quickstart/) to learn about adding sample datasets or [Managing indexes]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/im-plugin/index/) to learn about importing your own data.
- Have a foundational understanding of [OpenSearch documents and indexes]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/im-plugin/index/).
