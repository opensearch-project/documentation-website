# OpenSearch Assistant for OpenSearch Dashboards
**Introduced 2.13**
{: .label .label-purple }

The OpenSearch Assistant toolkit helps you create AI-powered assistants for OpenSearch Dashboards without requiring you to have specialized query tools or skills.

## Enabling OpenSearch Assistant

To enable **OpenSearch Assistant** in OpenSearch Dashboards, locate your copy of the `opensearch_dashboards.yml` file and set the following option:

```yaml
assistant.chat.enabled: true
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Then configure the root `agent_id` through the following API:

```json
PUT .plugins-ml-config/_doc/os_chat
{
    "type":"os_chat_root_agent",
    "configuration":{
        "agent_id": "your root agent id"
    }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

For more information about configuring the root agent, see the [Build your own chatbot tutorial]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/tutorials/build-chatbot/#step-5-configure-a-root-chatbot-agent-in-opensearch-dashboards).

This example shows a system index. In security-enabled domains, only super admins have permission to execute this code. For information about making super admin calls, see the [System indexes]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security/configuration/system-indices/) guide. For access permission, contact your IT administrator.

Next, restart the OpenSearch Dashboards server. Following a successful restart, **OpenSearch Assistant** appears in the OpenSearch Dashboards interface. 

A screenshot of the interface is shown in the following image.

## Configuring OpenSearch Assistant

You can use the OpenSearch Dashboards interface to configure OpenSearch Assistant. Go to the [Getting started guide](https://github.com/opensearch-project/dashboards-assistant/blob/main/GETTING_STARTED_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions. For the chatbot template, go to the [Flow Framework plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/flow-framework) documentation. You can modify this template to use your own model and customize the chatbot tools.
