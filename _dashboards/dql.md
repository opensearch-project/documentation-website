# Dashboards Query Language (DQL)

Dashboards Query Language (DQL) is a simple text-based query language used to filter data in OpenSearch Dashboards. 

DQL and [query string query]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/query-dsl/full-text/query-string/) (Lucene) language are the two search bar language options in Discover and Dashboards. This page provides a reference for the DQL syntax. For the Lucene syntax, see [Query string query]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/query-dsl/full-text/query-string/). For a syntax comparison, see the [Command quick reference](#dql-and-query-string-query-quick-reference).

By default, OpenSearch Dashboards uses DQL syntax. To switch to query string query (Lucene), select the **DQL** button next to the search box and then toggle the **On** switch, as shown in the following image. 

![Search term using DQL toolbar in Dashboard]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/dashboards/dql-interface.png)

The syntax changes to **Lucene**. To switch back to DQL, select the **Lucene** button and toggle the **Off** switch.

## Queries on analyzed text

When running queries, understanding whether your fields are analyzed ([`text`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/field-types/supported-field-types/text/) type) or non-analyzed ([`keyword`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/field-types/supported-field-types/keyword/) type) is crucial because it significantly impacts search behavior. In analyzed fields, text undergoes tokenization and filtering, while non-analyzed fields store exact values. For simple field queries like `wind`, searches against analyzed fields match documents containing `wind` regardless of case, while the same query on keyword fields requires exact matching of the full string. For more information about analyzed fields, see [Text analysis]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/analyzers/).

## Setup

To follow this tutorial in OpenSearch Dashboards, expand the following setup steps.

<details markdown="block">

  </summary>
  {: .text-delta}

Use the following steps to prepare sample data for querying.

**Step 1: Set up mappings for the index**

On the main menu, select **Management** > **Dev Tools** to open [Dev Tools]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/dashboards/dev-tools/run-queries/). Send the following request to create index mappings:

```json
PUT testindex
{
  "mappings" : {
    "properties" :  {
      "date" : {
        "type" : "date",
        "format" : "yyyy-MM-dd"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

**Step 2: Ingest the documents into the index**

In **Dev Tools**, ingest the following documents into the index:

```json
PUT /testindex/_doc/1
{
  "title": "The wind rises",
  "description": "A biographical film",
  "media_type": "film",
  "date": "2013-07-20",
  "page_views": 100
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

```json
PUT /testindex/_doc/2
{
  "title": "Gone with the wind",
  "description": "A well-known 1939 American epic historical film",
  "media_type": "film",
  "date": "1939-09-09",
  "page_views": 200
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

```json
PUT /testindex/_doc/3
{
  "title": "Chicago: the historical windy city",
  "media_type": "article",
  "date": "2023-07-29",
  "page_views": 300
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

```json
PUT /testindex/_doc/4
{
  "article title": "Wind turbines",
  "media_type": "article",
  "format": "2*3"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

**Step 3: Create an index pattern**

Follow these steps to create an index pattern for your index:

1. On the main menu, select **Management** > **Dashboards Management**. 
1. Select **Index patterns** and then **Create index pattern**.
1. In **Index pattern name**, enter `testindex*`. Select **Next step**.
1. In **Time field**, select `I don't want to use the time filter`.
1. Select **Create index pattern**.

For more information about index patterns, see [Index patterns]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/dashboards/management/index-patterns/).

**Step 4: Navigate to Discover and select the index pattern**

On the main menu, select **Discover**. In the upper-left corner, select `testindex*` from the **Index patterns** dropdown list. The main panel displays the documents in the index, and you can now try out the DQL queries described on this page.

The [Object fields](#object-fields) and [Nested fields](#nested-fields) sections provide links for additional setup needed to try queries in those sections.

## Search for terms

By default, DQL searches in the field set as the default field on the index. If the default field is not set, DQL searches all fields. For example, the following query searches for documents containing the words `rises` or `wind` in any of their fields:

```python
rises wind
```
{% include copy.html %}

The preceding query matches documents in which any search term appears regardless of the order. By default, DQL combines search terms with an `or`. To learn how to create Boolean expressions containing search terms, see [Boolean operators](#boolean-operators). 

To search for a phrase (an ordered sequence of words), surround your text with quotation marks. For example, the following query searches for the exact text "wind rises":

```python
"wind rises"
```
{% include copy.html %}

Hyphens are reserved characters in Lucene, so if your search term contains hyphens, DQL might prompt you to switch to Lucene syntax. To avoid this, surround your search term with quotation marks in a phrase search or omit the hyphen in a regular search.
{: .tip}

## Reserved characters

The following is a list of reserved characters in DQL:

`\`, `(`, `)`, `:`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `*`

Use a backslash (`\`) to escape reserved characters. For example, to search for an expression `2*3`, specify the query as `2\*3`:

```plaintext
2\*3
```
{% include copy.html %}

## Search in a field

To search for text in a particular field, specify the field name before the colon:

```python
title: rises wind
```
{% include copy.html %}

The analyzer for the field you're searching parses the query text into tokens and matches documents in which any of the tokens appear.

DQL ignores white space characters, so `title:rises wind` and `title: rises wind` are the same. 
{: .tip}

Use wildcards to refer to field names containing spaces. For example, `article*title` matches the `article title` field.
{: .tip}

## Field names

Specify the field name before the colon. The following table contains example queries with field names.

Query | Criterion for a document to match | Matching documents from the `testindex` index
:--- | :--- | :---
`title: wind` | The `title` field contains the word `wind`. | 1, 2
`title: (wind OR windy)` | The `title` field contains the word `wind` or the word `windy`. | 1, 2, 3
`title: "wind rises"` | The `title` field contains the phrase `wind rises`. | 1
`title.keyword: The wind rises` | The `title.keyword` field exactly matches `The wind rises`. | 1
`title*: wind` | Any field that starts with `title` (for example, `title` and `title.keyword`) contains the word `wind` | 1, 2
`article*title: wind` | The field that starts with `article` and ends with `title` contains the word `wind`. Matches the field `article title`. | 4
`description:*` | Documents in which the field `description` exists. | 1, 2

## Wildcards

DQL supports wildcards (`*` only) in both search terms and field names, for example:

```python
t*le: *wind and rise*
```
{% include copy.html %}

## Ranges

DQL supports numeric inequalities using the `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` operators, for example: 

```python
page_views > 100 and page_views <= 300
```
{% include copy.html %}

You can use the range operators on dates. For example, the following query searches for documents containing dates within the 2013--2023 range, inclusive:

```python
date >= "2013-01-01" and date < "2024-01-01"
```
{% include copy.html %}

You can query for "not equal to" by using `not` and the field name, for example: 

```python
not page_views: 100
```
{% include copy.html %}

Note that the preceding query returns documents in which either the `page_views` field does not contain `100` or the field is not present. To filter by those documents that contain the field `page_views`, use the following query:

```python
page_views:* and not page_views: 100
```
{% include copy.html %}

## Boolean operators

DQL supports the `and`, `or`, and `not` Boolean operators. DQL is not case sensitive, so `AND` and `and` are the same. For example, the following query is a conjunction of two Boolean clauses: 

```python
title: wind and description: epic
```
{% include copy.html %}

Boolean operators follow the logical precedence order of `not`, `and`, and `or`, so in the following example, `title: wind and description: epic` is evaluated first:

```python
media_type: article or title: wind and description: epic
```
{% include copy.html %}

To dictate the order of evaluation, group Boolean clauses in parentheses. For example, in the following query, the parenthesized expression is evaluated first:

```python
(media_type: article or title: wind) and description: epic
```
{% include copy.html %}

The field prefix refers to the token that immediately follows the colon. For example, the following query searches for documents in which the `title` field contains `windy` or documents containing the word `historical` in any of their fields:

```python
title: windy or historical
```
{% include copy.html %}

To search for documents in which the `title` field contains `windy` or `historical`, group the terms in parentheses:

```python
title: (windy or historical)
```
{% include copy.html %}

The preceding query is equivalent to `title: windy or title: historical`.

To negate a query, use the `not` operator. For example, the following query searches for documents that contain the word `wind` in the `title` field, are not of the `media_type` `article`, and do not contain `epic` in the `description` field:

```python
title: wind and not (media_type: article or description: epic)
```
{% include copy.html %}

Queries can contain multiple grouping levels, for example:

```python
title: ((wind or windy) and not rises)
```
{% include copy.html %}

## Object fields

To refer to an object's inner field, list the dot path of the field. 

To index a document containing an object, follow the steps in the [object field type example]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/field-types/supported-field-types/object/#example). To search the `name` field of the `patient` object, use the following syntax:

```python
patient.name: john
```
{% include copy.html %}

## Nested fields

To refer to a nested object, list the JSON path of the field. 

To index a document containing an object, follow the steps in the [nested field type example]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/field-types/supported-field-types/nested/#nested-field-type-1).

To search the `name` field of the `patients` object, use the following syntax:

```python
patients: {name: john}
```
{% include copy.html %}

To retrieve documents that match multiple fields, specify all the fields. For example, consider an additional `status` field in the following document:

```json
{ 
  "status": "Discharged",
  "patients": [ 
    {"name" : "John Doe", "age" : 56, "smoker" : true},
    {"name" : "Mary Major", "age" : 85, "smoker" : false}
  ] 
}
```

To search for a discharged patient whose name is John, specify the `name` and the `status` in the query:

```python
patients: {name: john} and status: discharged
```
{% include copy.html %}

You can combine multiple Boolean and range queries to create a more refined query, for example:

```python
patients: {name: john and smoker: true and age < 57} 
```
{% include copy.html %}

## Doubly nested fields 

Consider a document with a doubly nested field. In this document, both the `patients` and `names` fields are of type `nested`:

```json
{
  "patients": [
    {
      "names": [
        { "name": "John Doe", "age": 56, "smoker": true },
        { "name": "Mary Major", "age": 85, "smoker": false}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

To search the `name` field of the `patients` object, use the following syntax:

```python
patients: {names: {name: john}}
```
{% include copy.html %}

In contrast, consider a document in which the `patients` field is of type `object` but the `names` field is of type `nested`:

```json
{
  "patients": 
  {
    "names": [
      { "name": "John Doe", "age": 56, "smoker": true },
      { "name": "Mary Major", "age": 85, "smoker": false}
    ]
  }
}
```

To search the `name` field of the `patients` object, use the following syntax:

```python
patients.names: {name: john}
```
{% include copy.html %}
