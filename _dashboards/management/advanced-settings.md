# Advanced settings

Use the **Advanced settings** page to modify settings that govern OpenSearch Dashboards behavior. These settings can be used to customize the look and feel of the application, change the behavior of certain features, and more. To access **Advanced settings**, go to **Dashboards Management** and select **Advanced settings**. The page is divided into several sections, each 
containing a set of related settings. You can modify these settings by editing the their fields. Once you've made the changes, select **Save** to apply them.  

Certain settings require you to modify the `opensearch-dashboards.yml` configuration file and restart OpenSearch Dashboards.

## Required permissions

To modify settings, you must have permission to make changes. See [Multi-tenancy configuration](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security/multi-tenancy/multi-tenancy-config/#give-roles-access-to-tenants) for guidance about giving role access to tenants.
