# Advanced settings

Use the **Advanced settings** page to modify settings that govern OpenSearch Dashboards behavior. For example, you can use the page to enable or disable the dark mode, change the default language, change the default number of results displayed on a dashboard, or change the default time zone. You can configure most settings in **Advanced settings**. Certain operations require you to modify the `opensearch-dashboards.yml` configuration file and restart OpenSearch Dashboards.

To modify settings in **Advanced settings**, follow these steps:

1. Open the OpenSearch Dashboards main menu, then select **Dashboards Management** > **Advanced settings**.
2. Search for the setting you want to modify.
3. Enter a new value for the setting. 
4. Select **Save changes**, and refresh the page as prompted. 

## Required permissions

To modify settings, you must have permission to make changes. Contact your system administrator for access.
