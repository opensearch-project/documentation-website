# Top N queries

Monitoring the top N queries in query insights features can help you gain real-time insights into the top queries with high latency within a certain time frame (for example, the last hour). 

## Configuring top N query monitoring

You can configure top N query monitoring by the following metric types:

- `latency`
- `cpu`
- `memory`

Each metric has a set of corresponding settings:

- `search.insights.top_queries.<metric>.enabled`: Set to `true` to [enable top N query monitoring](#enabling-top-n-query-monitoring) by the metric.
- `search.insights.top_queries.<metric>.window_size`: [Configure the window size of the top N queries](#configuring-the-window-size) by the metric. 
- `search.insights.top_queries.<metric>.top_n_size`: [Specify the value of N for the top N queries by the metric](#configuring-the-value-of-n).

For example, to enable top N query monitoring by CPU usage, set `search.insights.top_queries.cpu.enabled` to `true`. For more information about ways to specify dynamic settings, see [Dynamic settings]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/configuring-opensearch/index/#dynamic-settings).

It's important to exercise caution when enabling this feature because it can consume system resources.

## Enabling top N query monitoring 

When you install the `query-insights` plugin, top N query monitoring is disabled by default. To enable top N query monitoring, update the dynamic settings for the desired metric types. These settings enable the corresponding collectors and aggregators in the running cluster. For example, to enable top N query monitoring by latency, update the `search.insights.top_queries.latency.enabled` setting:

```json
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent" : {
    "search.insights.top_queries.latency.enabled" : true
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Configuring the window size

To configure the monitoring window size, update the `window_size` setting for the desired metric type. For example, to collect the top N queries by latency in a 60-minute window, update the `search.insights.top_queries.latency.window_size` setting:

```json
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent" : {
    "search.insights.top_queries.latency.window_size" : "60m"
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Configuring the value of N 

To configure the value of N, update the `top_n_size` setting for the desired metric type. For example, to collect the top 10 queries by latency, update the `insights.top_queries.latency.top_n_size` setting:

```json
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent" : {
    "search.insights.top_queries.latency.top_n_size" : 10
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Monitoring the top N queries 

You can use the Insights API endpoint to obtain the top N queries for all metric types:

```json
GET /_insights/top_queries
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Specify a metric type to filter the response:

```json
GET /_insights/top_queries?type=latency
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

```json
GET /_insights/top_queries?type=cpu
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

```json
GET /_insights/top_queries?type=memory
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Exporting top N query data

You can configure your desired exporter to export top N query data to different sinks, allowing for better monitoring and analysis of your OpenSearch queries. Currently, the following exporters are supported:
- [Debug exporter](#configuring-a-debug-exporter)
- [Local index exporter](#configuring-a-local-index-exporter)

### Configuring a debug exporter

To configure a debug exporter, update the exporter setting for the desired metric type. For example, to export the top N queries by latency using the debug exporter, send the following request:

```json
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent" : {
     "search.insights.top_queries.latency.exporter.type" : "debug"
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Configuring a local index exporter

A local index exporter allows you to export the top N queries to local OpenSearch indexes. The default index pattern for top N query indexes is `top_queries-YYYY.MM.dd`. All top queries from the same day are saved to the same index, and a new index is created each day. You can change the default index pattern to use other date formats. For more information about supported formats, see [DateTimeFormat](https://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormat.html).

To configure the local index exporter for the top N queries by latency, send the following request:

```json
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent" : {
    "search.insights.top_queries.latency.exporter.type" : "local_index",
    "search.insights.top_queries.latency.exporter.config.index" : "YYYY.MM.dd"
  }
}
```
