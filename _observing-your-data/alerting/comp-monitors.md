## About composite monitors

Basic [monitor types]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/alerting/monitors/#monitor-types) for the Alerting plugin are designed to define a single trigger type. For example, a document level monitor can trigger an alert based on a query's match with documents, while a bucket level monitor can trigger an alert based on queries aimed at aggregated values in a data source. The composite monitor extends the usefulness of the individual monitor types by providing functionality that can chain the output of multiple monitor types into a single workflow that includes multiple triggers and permits analysis of a data source based on multiple criteria. This allows you to derive more granular information about a data source, and it doesn't require you to manually coordinate the scheduling of the separate monitors.

Composite monitors solve limitations with basic monitors in the following ways:

* Composite monitors give you the ability to create complex queries through a combination of triggers generated by multiple types of monitors.
* They have the capacity to define a pipeline of rules and queries that are run as a single execution.
* They can chain together individual monitors so that the output of one can act as the input for the next, repeating this through the entire sequence of the execution.
* They provide a more complete view of a given data source by running multiple monitors and multiple types of monitors in sequence, creating finer focused results and reducing noise in the results.


## Key terms

The key terms in the following table describe the basic concepts behind composite monitors. For additional terms common to all types of monitors, see [Key terms]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/alerting/monitors/#key-terms) for basic monitors.

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| Composite monitor | A combination of multiple individual monitors that includes functionality to execute each monitor in a sequence. The compound monitor can query different aspects of a dataset based on the type of monitors included in the composite monitor's definition.  |
| Delegate monitor | Any monitor used in the chained workflow of a compound monitor. Composite monitors support per query, per bucket, and per document monitor types as delegate monitors. Delegate monitors are executed sequentially according to their order in the monitor definition. |
| Chained finding | A sequence of findings where the findings for each monitor are used as the inputs for subsequent monitors. 
| Chained alert | Chained alerts are generated from composite monitor triggers when delegate monitors generate alerts. The chained alert trigger condition supports the use of the logical operators AND, OR, and NOT so you can combine multiple functions into a single expression. |
| Audit alert | Delegate monitors generate alerts in an **audit** state. Users are not notified about each individual audit alert and don't need to acknowledge them. Audit alerts are used to evaluate chained alert trigger conditions in composite monitors. |
| Execution | A single run of all delegate monitors in the sequence defined in the composite monitor's configuration. |
| Execution Id | Allows for the management of data recorded from a specific execution of a composite monitor. The execution Id associates findings and alerts with the execution and is stored in each monitor's metadata, along with the workflow Id and the monitor Id. |


## Example workflows

In a composite monitor, the chained outputs from the individual delegate monitors can be either findings or alerts. The following sections describe the workflow for each and provide an example of how they work.


### Chained findings

As an example of chained findings, consider a composite monitor configured with two delegate monitors. The second monitor is defined to use findings from the first as its input.

* The first delegate monitor (monitor #1) is a per document monitor configured to analyze a data source with the following three queries:
   
   1. Request payload size greater than 100 Kb.
   2. Response status = 200.
   3. Response contains a specific header.
   
   For every execution, the monitor queries the data source and generates findings for documents that match the conditions set out by the queries. These results by themselves are valuable. However, by adding a second monitor the sequence can apply further analysis to events in the data source.
* The second monitor (monitor #2) is a per bucket monitor that aggregates data by client IP, checks how many IPs there are, and determines how many IPs are sending these types of requests. The composite monitor configuration provides a way to add the second monitor in sequence so that it executes following the first.
* Monitor #2 first filters the findings from Monitor #1 and then queries the data derived from monitor #1. Matches with this second set of queries then generate triggers and alerts for notifications.
* Both monitors #1 and #2 return trigger results to the composite monitor according to their sequence in the configuration. The composite monitor returns a list of trigger results from monitors #1 and #2.

The following image shows a simplified workflow for a composite monitor with chained findings.

### Chained alerts

As an example of chained alerts, consider a composite monitor configured with three delegate monitors. The first and second monitors (monitors #1 and #2) are configured to generate audit alerts when two specific events happen across the cluster. A third monitor (monitor #3) is configured to send an alert when both monitors #1 and #2 generate their own alerts.

* Delegate monitor #1 is configured to monitor CPU utilization of a service’s worker nodes. The monitor includes trigger conditions that create audit alerts when the CPU experiences loads above a set threshold.
* Delegate monitor #2 is configured to monitor incoming request counts during the same time window. The monitor includes trigger conditions that create audit alerts when the number of requests rises above a set threshold.
* Delegate monitor #3 is configured to check whether monitors #1 and #2 have created alerts. If both monitors #1 and #2 have created alerts, monitor #3 creates its own alert and sends a notification that the service is experiencing a high volume of traffic and its performance is degraded.
* The first monitor's configuration may allow for alerts due to a number of reasons, such as cluster instability or several background processes running simultaneously. So an alert for this condition alone has limited value. Similarly, monitor #2 may identify a large number of requests and send an alert, even if the cluster is able to handle the traffic. Monitor #3 filters for these two conditions and triggers an alert when they both exist. This narrows the criteria for sending notifications, which also improves the meaningfulness of the alert while removing extraneous alerts that provide no deterministic value.

The following image shows a simplified workflow for a compound monitor with chained alerts.

## Managing composite monitors with the API

You can manage composite monitors using the REST API or OpenSearch Dashboards. Currently, the API offers the most versatility for defining composite monitors. The API configuration includes options to create composite monitors that chain findings and monitors that chain alerts. OpenSearch Dashboards is available for creating composite monitors that chain alerts.

#### Using Painless scripting language to define alert chains

Composite monitor configuration employs the [Painless scripting language](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/painless/7.17/painless-guide.html) to define the conditions for chaining alerts. Conditions are applied for each execution of the composite monitor. You specify the definition for the chain in the `triggers.chained_alert_triggers.condition.script.source` field of the request. Using Painless syntax, you can apply logic to links between monitors with basic Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT, and precedence.

* AND = `&&`
* OR = `||`
* NOT = `!`
* Precedence = `()`

See the following examples to understand how each is used in the monitor definition.

* **Example 1**
   
   `monitor[id=1] && monitor[id=2]`
   
   The following conditions for delegate monitors will trigger the composite monitor to produce an alert when both monitor #1 AND monitor #2 generate an alert.

* **Example 2**
   
   `monitor[id=1] || monitor[id=2]`

   The following conditions will trigger the composite monitor to produce an alert when either monitor #1 OR monitor #2 generates an alert.

* **Example 3**
   
   `monitor[id=1] && (!monitor[id=2] || monitor[id=3])`

   The following conditions will trigger the composite monitor to produce an alert when monitor #1 generates an alert AND monitor #2 does NOT, OR, monitor #3 does generate an alert.
   
The order of monitor IDs in the Painless script does not define the sequence of execution for the monitors. The sequence of monitor execution is defined in the `inputs.composite_input.sequence.delegates.order` field in the request.

## Creating composite monitors in OpenSearch Dashboards

Begin by navigating to the **Create monitor** page in OpenSearch Dashboards: **Alerting > Monitors > Create monitor**. Then select **Composite monitor** in the **Monitor details** section. Steps for creating a composite monitor workflow and triggers vary depending on whether you use the **Visual editor** or the **Extraction query editor**. In either case, the first step is to define the schedule.

In the **Frequency** dropdown list, select either **By interval**, **Daily**, **Weekly**, **Monthly**, or **Custom cron expression**.
  * **By interval** — Allows you to run the schedule repeatedly based on the number of minutes, hours, or days you specify.
  * **Daily** — Specify a time of day and a timezone.
  * **Weekly** — Specify a day of the week, a time of day, and a timezone.
  * **Monthly** — Specify a day of the month, a time of day, and a timezone.
  * **Custom cron expression** — Create a custom cron expression for the schedule. Use the **cron expressions** link for help with creating these expressions, or see [Cron expression reference]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/alerting/cron/).

For the remaining steps, refer to either **Visual editor** or the **Extraction query editor** in the following sections.

### Visual editor

To finish creating a composite monitor in the Visual editor, follow these steps:

1. In the **Delegate monitors** section, enter the individual monitors you want to include in the workflow by selecting them in the dropdown lists. Select **Add another monitor** to add another dropdown list. A minimum of two delegate monitors are required, and a maximum of 10 are allowed in total. Keep in mind that composite monitors support per query, per bucket, and per document monitors as delegate monitors.
   
   Beside each dropdown list, you can select the View monitor icon ({::nomarkdown}<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/dashboards/view-monitor-icon.png" class="inline-icon" alt="view monitor icon"/>{:/}) to open the monitor's details window and review information about it.
   
1. Define a trigger or triggers for the composite monitor. In the **Triggers** section, select **Add trigger**. Add a trigger name, then define the trigger conditions.
  * Use the **Select delegate monitor** label to open the condition and monitor selector popup window.
  
    <img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/alerting/trigger1.png" alt="This popup window shows options for selecting a delegate monitor and trigger condition operator" width="50%">

After the operator is applied, you can always select the operator between the two monitors to open the dropdown list and change the selection.
    * Select the severity level for the alert. The options include 1 (Highest), 2 (High), 3 (Medium), 4 (Low), and 5 (Lowest).

If no channels exist, select the **Manage channels** label to the right of the dropdown list to set up a notification channel. For more information about notifications, see the [Notifications]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/notifications/index/) documentation. You can also select **Add notification** to specify additional notifications for the alert trigger.
