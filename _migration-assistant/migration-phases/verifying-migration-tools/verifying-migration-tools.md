# Verifying migration tools

Before you begin migrating data, it is important to verify that each component of your migration workflow is correctly deployed and functioning as expected. This step reduces the risk of disruptions during cutover and helps identify misconfigurations early in the process.

Use the following pages to verify key components:

- [Verifying backfill components]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/migration-assistant/migration-phases/verifying-migration-tools/verifying-backfill-components/)
- [Verifying live capture components]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/migration-assistant/migration-phases/verifying-migration-tools/verifying-live-capture-components/)
