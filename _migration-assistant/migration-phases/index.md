This page details how to conduct a migration with Migration Assistant. It encompasses a variety of scenarios including:

- [**Metadata migration**]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/migration-assistant/migration-phases/migrating-metadata/): Migrating cluster metadata, such as index settings, aliases, and templates.
- [**Backfill migration**]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/migration-assistant/migration-phases/backfill/): Migrating existing or historical data from a source to a target cluster.
- **Live traffic migration**: Replicating live ongoing traffic from a source to a target cluster.
