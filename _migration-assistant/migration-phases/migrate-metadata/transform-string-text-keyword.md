# Transform string fields to text/keyword


This guide explains how Migration Assistant automatically handles the deprecated `string` field type during migration from earlier Elasticsearch versions.

## Overview

The `string` field type was the primary text field type in early versions of Elasticsearch but was deprecated in Elasticsearch 5.x and completely removed in Elasticsearch 6.0. In Elasticsearch 5.x, it remained available in backward compatibility mode only.

When migrating from Elasticsearch 1.x through 5.x to later versions, Migration Assistant automatically converts `string` field types to their modern equivalents: `text` for analyzed fields and `keyword` for non-analyzed fields.

To determine whether an Elasticsearch cluster uses `string` field types, make a call to your source cluster's `GET /_mapping` API. In the migration console, run `console clusters curl source_cluster "/_mapping"`. If you see `"type":"string"`, then this transformation is applicable and these fields will be automatically transformed during migration.

## Compatibility

The `string` to `text`/`keyword` field type transformation applies to:
- **Source clusters**: Elasticsearch 1.x--5.x
- **Target clusters**: Elasticsearch 5.x+ or OpenSearch 1.x+
- **Automatic conversion**: No configuration required during metadata migrations.

## Automatic conversion logic

Migration Assistant determines whether to convert a `string` field to `text` or `keyword` based on the field's `index` property.

### Conversion to `keyword`
Fields are converted to `keyword` when:
- `index: "not_analyzed"`
- `index: "no"`
- `index: false`

### Conversion to `text`
Fields are converted to `text` when:
- `index: "analyzed"`
- `index` is undefined

### Property cleanup

During conversion, Migration Assistant also cleans up properties that are incompatible with the target field type.

**For `keyword` fields**, the following properties are removed:
- `analyzer`
- `search_analyzer`
- `position_increment_gap`
- `term_vector`
- `fielddata`

**For `text` fields**, the following properties are removed:
- `doc_values`
- `null_value` (if present)

Additionally, legacy `index` values are normalized:
- `index: "analyzed"` and `index: "not_analyzed"` are removed (Elasticsearch 5.x default is `true`).
- `index: "no"` becomes `index: false`.

## Migration output

During the migration process, you'll see this transformation in the output:

```
Transformations:
   string to text/keyword:
      Convert field type string to text/keyword based on field data mappings
```

## Behavior differences

Migration Assistant automatically converts all `string` fields during metadata migration. No additional configuration is required.

### Mixed field types

If your source cluster already contains a mix of `string`, `text`, and `keyword` fields (common in Elasticsearch 5.x with restored Elasticsearch 2.x indexes), only the `string` fields will be converted. Existing `text` and `keyword` fields remain unchanged.

### Query and aggregation impacts

After migration, be aware of these key differences:

- **Term queries** work differently on `text` (analyzed) and `keyword` (exact match) fields.
- **Aggregations**: `text` fields cannot be used for aggregations unless `fielddata` is enabled; `keyword` fields are aggregation ready.
- **Sorting**: `text` fields cannot be used for sorting by default; `keyword` fields support sorting.
- **Case sensitivity**: `keyword` fields are case sensitive; `text` fields depend on the analyzer.

### Application compatibility

Review your application code for:
- Queries that expect the old `string` field behavior.
- Aggregations or sorting on fields now converted to `text`.
- Case-sensitive searches on fields now using `keyword`.

For fields requiring both analyzed and exact-match capabilities, consider using multi-fields with both `text` and `keyword` mappings after migration.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with string field conversion:

1. **Verify source version** -- Ensure your source cluster is running Elasticsearch 1.x through 5.x.

2. **Check migration logs** -- Review the detailed migration logs for any warnings or errors:
   ```bash
   tail /shared-logs-output/migration-console-default/*/metadata/*.log
   ```

3. **Validate mappings** -- After migration, verify that the field types have been correctly converted:
   ```bash
   GET /your-index/_mapping
   ```

4. **Review field usage** -- Ensure that your application queries are compatible with the new field types. Queries that worked with `string` fields should continue to work with `text` and `keyword` fields, but some advanced features may behave differently.
