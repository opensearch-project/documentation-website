# Handling breaking changes in field types

This guide explains how to use Migration Assistant to transform field types that are deprecated or incompatible during a migration to OpenSearch.

Field types define how data is stored and queried in an index. Each field in a document is mapped to a data type, which determines how it is indexed and what operations can be performed on it.

For example, the following index mapping for a library's book collection defines three fields, each with a different type:

```json
GET /library-books/_mappings
{
  "library-books": {
    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "title":          { "type": "text" },
        "publishedDate":  { "type": "date" },
        "pageCount":      { "type": "integer" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For more information, see [Mappings and field types]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/field-types/).

## Configure item transformations

You can customize how field types are transformed during metadata and data migrations by supplying a transformation configuration file using the following steps:

1. Open the Migration Assistant console.
2. Create a JavaScript file to define your transformation logic using the following command:

   ```bash
   vim /shared-logs-output/field-type-converter.js
   ```
   {% include copy.html %}

3. Write any JavaScript rules that perform the desired field type conversions. For an example of how the rules can be implemented, see the [example `field-type-converter.js` implementation](#example-field-type-converterjs-implementation).
4. Create a transformation descriptor file using the following command:

   ```bash
   vim /shared-logs-output/transformation.json
   ```
   {% include copy.html %}

5. Add a reference to your JavaScript file in `transformation.json`.
6. Run the metadata migration and supply the transformation configuration using a command similar to the following:

   ```bash
   console metadata migrate \
     --transformer-config-file /shared-logs-output/transformation.json
   ```
   {% include copy.html %}

### Example `field-type-converter.js` implementation

The following script demonstrates how to perform common field type conversions, including:

* Replacing the deprecated `string` type with `text`.
* Converting `flattened` to `flat_object` and removing the `index` property if present.

```javascript
function main(context) {
  const rules = [
    {
      when: { type: "string" },
      set: { type: "text" }
    },
    {
      when: { type: "flattened" },
      set: { type: "flat_object" },
      remove: ["index"]
    }
  ];

  function applyRules(node, rules) {
    if (Array.isArray(node)) {
      node.forEach((child) => applyRules(child, rules));
    } else if (node instanceof Map) {
      for (const { when, set, remove = [] } of rules) {
        const matches = Object.entries(when).every(([k, v]) => node.get(k) === v);
        if (matches) {
          Object.entries(set).every(([k, v]) => node.set(k, v));
          remove.forEach((key) => node.delete(key));
        }
      }
      for (const child of node.values()) {
        applyRules(child, rules);
      }
    } else if (node && typeof node === "object") {
      for (const { when, set, remove = [] } of rules) {
        const matches = Object.entries(when).every(([k, v]) => node[k] === v);
        if (matches) {
          Object.assign(node, set);
          remove.forEach((key) => delete node[key]);
        }
      }
      Object.values(node).forEach((child) => applyRules(child, rules));
    }
  }

  return (doc) => {
    if (doc && doc.type && doc.name && doc.body) {
      applyRules(doc, rules);
    }
    return doc;
  };
}
(() => main)();
```
{% include copy.html %}

The script contains the following elements:

1. The `rules` array defines transformation logic:

   * `when`: Key-value conditions to match on a node
   * `set`: Key-value pairs to apply when the `when` clause matches
   * `remove` (optional): Keys to delete from the node when matched

2. The `applyRules` function recursively traverses the input:

   * Arrays are recursively processed element by element.
   * `Map` objects are matched and mutated using the defined rules.
   * Plain objects are checked for matches and transformed accordingly.

3. The `main` function returns a transformation function that:

   * Applies the rules to each document.
   * Returns the modified document for migration or replay.

### Example `transformation.json`

The following JSON file references your transformation script and initializes the JavaScript engine with your custom rules:

```json
[
  {
    "JsonJSTransformerProvider": {
      "initializationScriptFile": "/shared-logs-output/field-type-converter.js",
      "bindingsObject": "{}"
    }
  }
]
```
{% include copy.html %}

## Summary

By using a transformation configuration, you can rewrite deprecated or incompatible field types during metadata migration or data replay. This ensures that your target OpenSearch cluster only receives compatible mappingsâ€”even if the source cluster includes outdated types like `string` or features like `flattened` that need conversion.
