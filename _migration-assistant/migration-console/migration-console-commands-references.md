# Migration console command reference

Migration console commands follow this syntax: `console [component] [action]`. The components include `clusters`, `backfill`, `snapshot`, `metadata`, and `replay`. The console is configured with a registry of the deployed services and the source and target cluster, generated from the `cdk.context.json` values.

## Commonly used commands

The exact commands used will depend heavily on use-case and goals, but the following are a series of common commands with a quick description of what they do.

### Check connection

Reports whether both the source and target clusters can be reached and provides their versions.

```sh
console clusters connection-check
```
{% include copy.html %}

### Run `cat-indices`

Runs the `cat-indices` API on the cluster.

```sh
console clusters cat-indices
```
{% include copy.html %}

### Create a snapshot

Creates a snapshot of the source cluster and stores it in a preconfigured Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.

```sh
console snapshot create
```
{% include copy.html %}

## Check snapshot status

Runs a detailed check on the snapshot creation status, including estimated completion time:

```sh
console snapshot status --deep-check
```
{% include copy.html %}

## Evaluate metadata

Performs a dry run of metadata migration, showing which indexes, templates, and other objects will be migrated to the target cluster.

```sh
console metadata evaluate
```
{% include copy.html %}

## Migrate metadata

Migrates the metadata from the source cluster to the target cluster.

```sh
console metadata migrate
```
{% include copy.html %}

## Start a backfill

If `Reindex-From-Snapshot` (RFS) is enabled, this command starts an instance of the service to begin moving documents to the target cluster:

There are similar `scale UNITS` and `stop` commands to change the number of active instances for RFS.


```sh
console backfill start
```
{% include copy.html %}

## Check backfill status

Gets the current status of the backfill migration, including the number of operating instances and the progress of the shards.


## Start Traffic Replayer

If Traffic Replayer is enabled, this command starts an instance of Traffic Replayer to begin replaying traffic against the target cluster.
The `stop` command stops all active instances.

```sh
console replay start
```
{% include copy.html %}

## Read logs

Reads any logs that exist when running Traffic Replayer. Use tab completion on the path to fill in the available `NODE_IDs` and, if applicable, log file names. The tuple logs roll over at a certain size threshold, so there may be many files named with timestamps. The `jq` command pretty-prints each line of the tuple output before writing it to file.

```sh
console tuples show --in /shared-logs-output/traffic-replayer-default/[NODE_ID]/tuples/console.log | jq > readable_tuples.json
```
{% include copy.html %}

## Help option

All commands and options can be explored within the tool itself by using the `--help` option, either for the entire `console` application or for individual components (for example, `console backfill --help`). For example:

```bash
$ console --help
Usage: console [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --config-file TEXT  Path to config file
  --json
  -v, --verbose       Verbosity level. Default is warn, -v is info, -vv is

  --help              Show this message and exit.
