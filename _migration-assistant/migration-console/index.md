# Migration console

The Migrations Assistant deployment includes an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) task that hosts tools that run different phases of the migration and check the progress or results of the migration. This ECS task is called the **migration console**. The migration console is a command line interface used to interact with the deployed components of the solution.

This section provides information about how to access the migration console and what commands are supported.
