# Security patching and updating

This page describes how to safely update the **bootstrap box** (the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud [Amazon EC2] instance you use to build and run Migration Assistant components), clean Docker caches, and rebuild the Migration Assistant container images.

> **Recommended cadence**: Perform these steps only when Migration Assistant is not actively running.

---

## Step 1: Patch the OS on the bootstrap box

```shell
sudo dnf upgrade --refresh -y
```
{% include copy.html %}

> **Note**: If the kernel or core libraries are updated, a reboot is often required.

Reboot if required:

```shell
sudo reboot
```
{% include copy.html %}

After the box comes back up, reconnect and continue.


## Step 2: Clear Docker build and download caches

Clearing the Docker build and downloaded caches removes **all** unused images, containers, networks, and volumes to free disk space and ensure clean rebuilds:

```shell
docker system prune -a --volumes
```
{% include copy.html %}


## Step 3: Clean prior Gradle outputs

From the repository root, run the following command to clean prior Gradle outputs:

```shell
./gradlew clean
```
{% include copy.html %}


## Step 4: Rebuild Migration Assistant images

Rebuild the Docker images used by Migration Assistant:

```shell
./gradlew :buildDockerImages -x test
```
{% include copy.html %}


## Step 5: Redeploy Migration Assistant

Redeploy Migration Assistant to replace existing container images with the freshly built versions:

```shell
cd deployment/cdk/opensearch-service-migration
./deploy.sh <contextId>
```
{% include copy.html %}

> **Warning**: Redeployment will interrupt any running migration tasks (for example, Capture Proxy, Traffic Replayer, or Reindex-from-Snapshot).
> **Do not** redeploy while actively migrating, as this can cause data loss or inconsistent state.
{: .warning}


## Troubleshooting

* **`toomanyrequests: Rate exceeded`**:
  Retry the last build command. Some downstream container images are rate limited and may change over time.

* **Cannot pull base images**:
  Ensure that the instance has internet egress (NAT/IGW) and access to Docker Hub/Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) as required.

* **Gradle cache corruption**:
  If problems persist after `./gradlew clean`, also remove `~/.gradle/caches` and retry.
