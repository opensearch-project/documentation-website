The Migrations Assistant deployment includes an ECS task that hosts tools to run different phases of the migration and check the progress or results of the migration. This ECS task is called the **Migration Console**. The migration console is a command line interface to interact with the deployed components of the solution.

This section details how to access the migration console and what commands are supported.
