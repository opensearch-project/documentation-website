You can use the Terraform OpenSearch provider to provision OpenSearch resources and interact with the OpenSearch API. The Terraform provider supports Amazon OpenSearch Service domains and OpenSearch clusters deployed on Kubernetes or another infrastructure. For more information, see the [Terraform provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/opensearch-project/opensearch/latest/docs).
