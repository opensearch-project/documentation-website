# Alerting
OpenSearch Dashboards
{: .label .label-yellow :}

The alerting feature notifies you when data from one or more OpenSearch indices meets certain conditions. For example, you might want to notify a [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel if your application logs more than five HTTP 503 errors in one hour, or you might want to page a developer if no new documents have been indexed in the past 20 minutes.

To get started, choose **Alerting** in OpenSearch Dashboards.
