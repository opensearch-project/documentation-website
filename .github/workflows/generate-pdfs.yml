# PDF generation is now integrated into the Jekyll build process
# PDFs are automatically generated during `jekyll build` and included in _site/pdfs/
# PDFs will be deployed with the site to S3, accessible at:
# https://docs.opensearch.org/pdfs/<filename>.pdf
#
# Note: The main Jekyll build workflow should install wkhtmltopdf:
#   - name: Install wkhtmltopdf
#     run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y wkhtmltopdf
