# Remote-backed storage

Remote-backed storage offers OpenSearch users a new way to protect against data loss by automatically creating backups of all index transactions and sending them to a supported cloud storage service. In order to expose this feature, segment replication must also be enabled. See [Segment replication]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/segment-replication/) for additional information.

Remote-backed storage is an experimental feature. Therefore, we do not recommend the use of remote-backed storage in a production environment. For updates on the progress of remote-backed storage, or if you want leave feedback that could help improve the feature, refer to the issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/1968).

## Enable the feature

In order to create new indexes with remote-backed storage enabled, you must first enable these features by adding the correct properties to `run.gradle` before building OpenSearch. See the [developer guide](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for information about how Gradle is used to build OpenSearch.

Add the following properties to `run.gradle` to enable the feature:

```bash
testClusters {
  runTask {
    testDistribution = 'archive'
    if (numZones > 1) numberOfZones = numZones
    if (numNodes > 1) numberOfNodes = numNodes
    systemProperty 'opensearch.experimental.feature.replication_type.enabled', 'true'
    systemProperty 'opensearch.experimental.feature.remote_store.enabled', 'true'
  }
}
```

Segment replication must also be enabled in order to use remote-backed storage.

After building OpenSearch with these properties, you must enable the feature for all nodes in your cluster. This can be done by modifying a `config/jvm.options`, or by defining `OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPS` from the command line.

### Option 1: Modify jvm.options

Add the following lines to `config/jvm.options` before starting the OpenSearch process to enable the feature and its dependency:

```
-Dopensearch.experimental.feature.replication_type.enabled=true
-Dopensearch.experimental.feature.remote_store.enabled=true
```

Run OpenSearch

```bash
./bin/opensearch
```

### Option 2: Enable from an environment variable

As an alternative to directly modifying `config/jvm.options`, you can define the properties by using an environment variable. This can be done in a single command when you start OpenSearch or by defining the variable with `export`.

To add these flags in-line when starting OpenSearch:

```bash
OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS="-Dopensearch.experimental.feature.replication_type.enabled=true -Dopensearch.experimental.feature.remote_store.enabled=true" ./opensearch-{{site.opensearch_version}}/bin/opensearch
```

If you want to define the environment variable separately, prior to running OpenSearch:

```bash
export OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS="-Dopensearch.experimental.feature.replication_type.enabled=true -Dopensearch.experimental.feature.remote_store.enabled=true"
./bin/opensearch
```

## Register a remote repository

Now that your deployment is running with the feature flags enabled, the next step is to register a remote repository where backups will be stored. See [Register repository]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/snapshots/snapshot-restore#register-repository) for more information.

## Create an index

Remote-backed storage is enabled for an index when it is created. This feature cannot be enabled for indexes that already exist.

When creating the index, include the `remote_store` property to enable the feature and specify a target repository:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://localhost:9200/my-index?pretty" -ku admin:admin -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "number_of_shards": 1,
      "number_of_replicas": 0,
      "replication": {
        "type": "SEGMENT"
      },
      "remote_store": {
        "enabled": true,
        "repository": "my-repo-1"
      }
    }
  }
}
'
```

All data that is added to the index will also be uploaded to the remote storage once it is committed.

### Restoring from a backup

To restore an index from a remote backup, such as in the event of a node failure, you must first close the index:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://localhost:9200/my-index/_close" -ku admin:admin
```

Restore the index from the backup stored on the remote repository:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://localhost:9200/_remotestore/_restore" -ku admin:admin -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "indices": ["my-index"]
}
'
```

If the security plugin is enabled, a user must have the `cluster:admin/remotestore/restore` permission. See [Access control](/security-plugin/access-control/index/) for information about configuring user permissions.
