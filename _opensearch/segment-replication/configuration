## Segment Replication Configuration

### Enabling the feature flag

#### Enable on a node using a tarball install

The flag is toggled using a new jvm parameter that is set in either `OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS` or in config/jvm.options.

1. Option 1. Update config/jvm.options with:

    ````json
    -Dopensearch.experimental.feature.replication_type.enabled=true
    ````

1. Option 2: Use the `OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable:

    ````json
    export OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS="-Dopensearch.experimental.feature.replication_type.enabled=true"
    ````

#### Enable with Docker containers

For Docker composer, add the following line to docker-compose.yml underneath the `opensearch-node` and `environment` section:

````json
OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS="-Dopensearch.experimental.feature.replication_type.enabled=true" # Enables segment replication
````

#### Setting replication strategy on the index

When creating an index via the REST interface, add `'{"settings" : { "index" : { "replication.type" : "SEGMENT" }}}'` to your payload:

````bash
curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/<index-name>?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"settings" : { "index" : { "replication.type" : "SEGMENT" }}}'
````

### Known Limitations

Segment Replication is currently experimental and not yet intended for production use.
{: .note }

1. Enabling segment replication for an existing index requires [reindexing](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/3685).
1. Rolling upgrades are currently not supported. Full cluster restarts are required to upgrade indexes using segment replication. [Issue 3881](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/3881).
1. [Cross cluster replication](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/4090) does not currently use segment replication to copy between clusters.
1. Network congestion on primary shards. [Issue - Optimize network bandwidth on primary shards](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/4245).
1. Shard allocation algorithms have not been updated to evenly spread primary shards across nodes.
1. Integration with a remote store as the source of replication is [currently unsupported](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/4448).
