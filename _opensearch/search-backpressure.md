# Search backpressure

Search backpressure is a mechanism used to identify resource-intensive search requests and cancel them when the node is under duress. If a search request on a node or shard has breached the resource limits and does not recover within a certain threshold, it is rejected. These thresholds are dynamic and configurable through [cluster settings](#search-backpressure-settings). 

## Measuring resource consumption

To decide whether to apply search backpressure, OpenSearch periodically measures the following resource consumption statistics for each search request:

- CPU usage
- Heap usage
- Elapsed time 

An observer thread periodically measures the resource usage of the node. If OpenSearch determines that the node is under duress, OpenSearch examines the resource usage of each search shard task and compares it against configurable thresholds. OpenSearch considers CPU usage, heap usage, and elapsed time and assigns each task a cancellation score that is then used to cancel the most resource-intensive tasks.

OpenSearch limits the number of cancellations to a fraction of successful task completions. Additionally, it limits the number of cancellations per unit time. OpenSearch continues to monitor and cancel tasks until the node is no longer under duress.

## Canceled queries

If a query is canceled, OpenSearch may return partial results if some shards failed. If all shards failed, OpenSearch returns an error from the server similar to the following error:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "root_cause": [
      {
          "type": "task_cancelled_exception",
          "reason": "cancelled task with reason: cpu usage exceeded [17.9ms >= 15ms], elapsed time exceeded [1.1s >= 300ms]"
      },
      {
          "type": "task_cancelled_exception",
          "reason": "cancelled task with reason: elapsed time exceeded [1.1s >= 300ms]"
      }
    ],
    "type": "search_phase_execution_exception",
    "reason": "all shards failed",
    "phase": "query",
    "grouped": true,
    "failed_shards": [
      {
        "shard": 0,
        "index": "foobar",
        "node": "7yIqOeMfRyWW1rHs2S4byw",
        "reason": {
            "type": "task_cancelled_exception",
            "reason": "cancelled task with reason: cpu usage exceeded [17.9ms >= 15ms], elapsed time exceeded [1.1s >= 300ms]"
        }
      },
      {
        "shard": 1,
        "index": "foobar",
        "node": "7yIqOeMfRyWW1rHs2S4byw",
        "reason": {
            "type": "task_cancelled_exception",
            "reason": "cancelled task with reason: elapsed time exceeded [1.1s >= 300ms]"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "status": 500
}
```

## Search backpressure modes

Search backpressure runs in `monitor_only` (default), `enforced`, or `disabled` mode. In the `enforced` mode, the server rejects search requests. In the `monitor_only` mode, the server does not actually cancel search requests but tracks statistics about them. You can specify the mode in the [`search_backpressure.mode`](#search-backpressure-settings) parameter.

## Search backpressure settings

Search backpressure adds several settings to the standard OpenSearch cluster settings. These settings are dynamic, so you can change the default behavior of this feature without restarting your cluster.
