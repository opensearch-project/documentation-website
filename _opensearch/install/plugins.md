## Install a plugin

If you are running OpenSearch in a Docker container, plugins must be installed, removed, and configured by modifying the Docker image. For information, see [Install, configure or remove plugins]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/install/docker#install-configure-or-remove-plugins)
{: .note}

The install command takes a plugin id, which may be any of the following:

- An official OpenSearch plugin name
- Maven coordinates to a plugin zip file
- A URL to a plugin zip file

If you're installing an official OpenSearch plugin, use:
```bash
bin/opensearch-plugin install <plugin-name>
```

For a plugin installed via zip, use:
```bash
bin/opensearch-plugin install <name|Zip File|Url>
```

Restart your OpenSearch node after installing a plugin.

## Batch mode

When installing plugins that require additional privileges not included by default, the plugins will prompt the user for confirmation of the required privileges. To grant all requested privileges, use batch mode to skip the confirmation prompt.

To force batch mode when installing plugins, add the `-b` or `--batch` option:
```bash
bin/opensearch-plugin install --batch <plugin-name>
```

## Remove a plugin

```bash
bin/opensearch-plugin remove <plugin-name>
```
Restart your OpenSearch node after removing a plugin.

## List installed plugins

To check which plugins are currently installed:

```bash
bin/opensearch-plugin list
```
