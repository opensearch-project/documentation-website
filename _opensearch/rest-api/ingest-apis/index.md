# Ingest APIs

Before you index your data, OpenSearch's ingest APIs help transform your data through the creation of ingest pipelines. Pipelines are made up of processors, a customizable task that run in succession. The transformed data appears in your data stream or index after each of the processors completes.

Ingest pipelines in OpenSearch are managed using ingest API operations. In production environments, your cluster should contain at least one node with the `node.roles: [ingest]`. For more information on setting up node roles within a cluster, see [Cluster Formation]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/cluster/).
