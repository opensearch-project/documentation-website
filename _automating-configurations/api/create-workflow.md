# Create or update a workflow

Creating a workflow adds the content of a workflow template to the flow framework system index. You can provide workflows in JSON format (by specifying `Content-Type: application/json`) or YAML format (by specifying `Content-Type: application/yaml`). By default, the workflow is validated to help identify invalid configurations, including:

* Workflow steps requiring an OpenSearch plugin that is not installed.
* Workflow steps relying on previous node input that is provided by those steps.
* Workflow step fields with invalid values.
* Workflow graph (node/edge) configurations containing cycles or with duplicate IDs.

To obtain the validation template for workflow steps, call the [Get Workflow Steps API]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/automating-configurations/api/get-workflow-steps/).

You can include placeholder expressions in the value of workflow step fields. For example, you can specify a credential field in a template as `openAI_key: '${{ openai_key }}'`. The expression will be substituted with the user-provided value during provisioning, using the format `${{ <value> }}`. You can pass the actual key as a parameter using the [Provision Workflow API]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/automating-configurations/api/provision-workflow/) or using this API with the `provision` parameter set to `true`.

Once a workflow is created, provide its `workflow_id` to other APIs.

The `POST` method creates a new workflow. The `PUT` method updates an existing workflow. 

You can only update a workflow if it has not yet been provisioned.
{: .note}

## Path and HTTP methods

```json
POST /_plugins/_flow_framework/workflow
PUT /_plugins/_flow_framework/workflow/<workflow_id>
```

## Path parameters

The following table lists the available path parameters. 

| Parameter | Data type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `workflow_id` | String | The ID of the workflow to be updated. Required for the `PUT` method. |

## Query parameters

Workflows are normally created and provisioned in separate steps. However, once you have thoroughly tested the workflow, you can combine the create and provision steps by including the `provision` query parameter:

```json
POST /_plugins/_flow_framework/workflow?provision=true
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

When set to `true`, the [Provision Workflow API]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/automating-configurations/api/provision-workflow/) is executed immediately following creation. 

By default, workflows are validated when they are created to ensure that the syntax is valid and that the graph does not contain cycles. This behavior can be controlled with the `validation` query parameter. If `validation` is set to `all`, OpenSearch performs a complete template validation. Any other value of the `validation` parameter suppresses validation, allowing an incomplete/work-in-progress template to be saved. To disable template validation, set `validation` to `none`:

```json
POST /_plugins/_flow_framework/workflow?validation=none
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The following table lists the available query parameters. All query parameters are optional. User-provided parameters are only allowed if the `provision` parameter is set to `true`.

| Parameter | Data type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `provision` | Boolean | Whether to provision the workflow as part of the request. Default is `false`. |
| `validation` | String | Whether to validate the workflow. Valid values are `all` (validate the template) and `none` (do not validate the template). Default is `all`. |
| User-provided substitution expressions | String | Parameters matching substitution expressions in the template. Only allowed if `provision` is set to `true`. Optional. If `provision` is set to `false`, you can pass these parameters in the [Provision Workflow API query parameters]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/automating-configurations/api/provision-workflow/#query-parameters). |

## Request fields

The following table lists the available request fields.

|Field	|Data type	|Required/Optional	|Description	|
|:---	|:---	|:---	|:---	|
|`name`	|String	|Required	|The name of the workflow.	|
|`description`	|String	|Optional	|A description of the workflow.	|
|`use_case`	|String	|Optional	| A use case, which can be used with the Search Workflow API to find related workflows. In the future, OpenSearch may provide some standard use cases to ease categorization, but currently you can use this field to specify custom values.	|
|`version`	|Object	|Optional	| A key-value map with two fields: `template`, which identifies the template version, and `compatibility`, which identifies a list of minimum required OpenSearch versions.	|
|`workflows`	|Object	|Optional	|A map of workflows. Presently, only the `provision` key is supported. The value for the workflow key is a key-value map that includes fields for `user_params` and lists of `nodes` and `edges`.	|

#### Example request: Register and deploy an externally hosted model (YAML)

To provide a template in YAML format, specify `Content-Type: application/yaml` in the request header:

```bash
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9200/_plugins/_flow_framework/workflow" -H 'Content-Type: application/yaml'
```

YAML templates permit comments. 
{: .tip}

The following is an example YAML template for registering and deploying an externally hosted model:

```yaml
# This name is required
name: createconnector-registerremotemodel-deploymodel
# Other fields are optional but useful
description: This template creates a connector to a remote model, registers it, and
  deploys that model
# Other templates with a similar use case can be searched
use_case: REMOTE_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT
version:
  # Templates may be versioned by their authors
  template: 1.0.0
  # Compatibility with OpenSearch 2.12.0 and higher and 3.0.0 and higher
  compatibility:
  - 2.12.0
  - 3.0.0
# One or more workflows can be included, presently only provision is supported
workflows:
  provision:
    # These nodes are the workflow steps corresponding to ML Commons APIs
    nodes:
    # This ID must be unique to this workflow
    - id: create_connector_1
      # There may be multiple steps with the same type
      type: create_connector
      # These inputs match the Create Connector API body
      user_inputs:
        name: OpenAI Chat Connector
        description: The connector to public OpenAI model service for GPT 3.5
        version: '1'
        protocol: http
        parameters:
          endpoint: api.openai.com
          model: gpt-3.5-turbo
        credential:
          openAI_key: '12345'
        actions:
        - action_type: predict
          method: POST
          url: https://${parameters.endpoint}/v1/chat/completions
    # This ID must be unique to this workflow
    - id: register_model_2
      type: register_remote_model
      # This step needs the connector_id produced as an output of the previous step
      previous_node_inputs:
        create_connector_1: connector_id
      # These inputs match the Register Model API body
      user_inputs:
        name: openAI-gpt-3.5-turbo
        function_name: remote
        description: test model
    # This ID must be unique to this workflow
    - id: deploy_model_3
      type: deploy_model
      # This step needs the model_id produced as an output of the previous step
      previous_node_inputs:
        register_model_2: model_id
    # Since the nodes include previous_node_inputs these are optional to define
    # They will be added automatically and included in the stored template
    # Additional edges may also be added here if required for sequencing
    edges:
    - source: create_connector_1
      dest: register_model_2
    - source: register_model_2
      dest: deploy_model_3
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

#### Example request: Register and deploy a remote model (JSON)

To provide a template in JSON format, specify `Content-Type: application/json` in the request header:

```bash
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9200/_plugins/_flow_framework/workflow" -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
The following JSON template is equivalent to the YAML template provided in the previous section:

          "source": "register_model_2",
          "dest": "deploy_model_3"
        }
      ]

{% include copy-curl.html %}

#### Example response

OpenSearch responds with the `workflow_id`:

```json
{
  "workflow_id" : "8xL8bowB8y25Tqfenm50"
}
```

Once you have created a workflow, you can use other workflow APIs with the `workflow_id`.
