# Provision a workflow

This is an experimental feature and is not recommended for use in a production environment. For updates on the progress of the feature or if you want to leave feedback, see the associated [GitHub issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/flow-framework/issues/475).    
{: .warning}

Provisioning a workflow is a one-time setup process usually performed by a cluster administrator to create resources that will be used by end users.  

The `workflows` template field may contain multiple workflows. The workflow with the `provision` key can be executed with this API. This API is also executed when the [Create or Update Workflow API]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/automating-configurations/api/create-workflow/) is called with the `provision` parameter set to `true`.

You can only provision a workflow if it has not yet been provisioned. Deprovision the workflow if you need to repeat provisioning.
