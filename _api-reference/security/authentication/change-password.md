**Introduced 1.0**
{: .label .label-purple }

The Change Password API allows users to update their own passwords. Users must provide their current password for verification before the password change is allowed.

<!-- spec_insert_start
api: security.change_password
component: endpoints
-->
## Endpoints
```json
PUT /_plugins/_security/api/account
```
<!-- spec_insert_end -->


<!-- spec_insert_start
api: security.change_password
component: request_body_parameters
-->
## Request body fields

The request body is __required__. It is a JSON object with the following fields.

| Property | Required | Data type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

## Password best practices

Proper password management is essential for securing your OpenSearch cluster. When using this API to change a password, keep the following guidelines in mind:

- You can only use this API to change the password of the currently authenticated user.
- Make sure the new password meets any configured password policies.
- Existing authentication tokens remain valid until they expire, even after the password changes.
- Use strong passwords that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

To enhance security, use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Incorporate regular password rotation into your organization's security policy to help protect against unauthorized access.
