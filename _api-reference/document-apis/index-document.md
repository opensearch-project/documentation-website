# Index document
Introduced 1.0
{: .label .label-purple}

Before you can search for data, you must first add documents. This operation adds a single document to your index.

## Example

```json
PUT sample-index/_doc/1
{
  "Description": "To be or not to be, that is the question."
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Path and HTTP methods

```
PUT <index>/_doc/<_id>
POST <index>/_doc

PUT <index>/_create/<_id>
POST <index>/_create/<_id>
```

## URL parameters

In your request, you must specify the index you want to add your document to. If the index doesn't already exist, OpenSearch automatically creates the index and adds in your document. All other URL parameters are optional.

Parameter | Type | Description | Required
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
&lt;index&gt; | String | Name of the index. | Yes
&lt;_id&gt; | String | A unique identifier to attach to the document. To automatically generate an ID, use `POST <target>/doc` in your request instead of PUT. | No
if_seq_no | Integer | Only perform the index operation if the document has the specified sequence number. | No
if_primary_term | Integer | Only perform the index operation if the document has the specified primary term.| No
op_type | Enum | Specifies the type of operation to complete with the document. Valid values are `create` (create the index if it doesn't exist) and `index`. If a document ID is included in the request, then the default is `index`. Otherwise, the default is `create`. | No
pipeline | String | Route the index operation to a certain pipeline. | No
routing | String | value used to assign the index operation to a specific shard. | No
refresh | Enum | If true, OpenSearch refreshes shards to make the operation visible to searching. Valid options are `true`, `false`, and `wait_for`, which tells OpenSearch to wait for a refresh before executing the operation. Default is false. | No
timeout | Time | How long to wait for a response from the cluster. Default is `1m`. | No
version | Integer | The document's version number. | No
version_type | Enum | Assigns a specific type to the document. Valid options are `external` (retrieve the document if the specified version number is greater than the document's current version) and `external_gte` (retrieve the document if the specified version number is greater than or equal to the document's current version). For example, to index version 3 of a document, use `/_doc/1?version=3&version_type=external`. | No
wait_for_active_shards | String | The number of active shards that must be available before OpenSearch processes the request. Default is 1 (only the primary shard). Set to `all` or a positive integer. Values greater than 1 require replicas. For example, if you specify a value of 3, the index must have two replicas distributed across two additional nodes for the operation to succeed. | No
require_alias | Boolean | Specifies whether the target index must be an index alias. Default is false. | No
