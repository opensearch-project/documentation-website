# Document APIs

The document APIs allow you to handle documents relative to your index, such as adding, updating, and deleting documents.

Document APIs are separated into two categories: single document operations and multi-document operations. Multi-document operations offer performance advantages over submitting many individual requests, so whenever practical, we recommend that you use multi-document operations.

## Single document operations

- Index
- Get
- Delete
- Update

## Multi-document operations

- Bulk
- Multi get
- Delete by query
- Update by query
- Reindex
