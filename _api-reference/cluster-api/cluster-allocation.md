# Cluster allocation explain
Introduced 1.0
{: .label .label-purple }

The most basic cluster allocation explain request finds an unassigned shard and explains why it can't be allocated to a node.

If you add some options, you can instead get information on a specific shard, including why OpenSearch assigned it to its current node.


## Example

```json
GET _cluster/allocation/explain?include_yes_decisions=true
{
  "index": "movies",
  "shard": 0,
  "primary": true
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Path and HTTP methods

```
GET _cluster/allocation/explain
POST _cluster/allocation/explain
```


## URL parameters

All cluster allocation explain parameters are optional.

Parameter | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
include_yes_decisions | Boolean | OpenSearch makes a series of yes or no decisions when trying to allocate a shard to a node. If this parameter is true, OpenSearch includes the (generally more numerous) "yes" decisions in its response. Default is false.
include_disk_info | Boolean | Whether to include information about disk usage in the response. Default is false.


## Request body

All cluster allocation explain fields are optional.

Field | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
current_node | String | If you only want an explanation if the shard happens to be on a particular node, specify that node name here.
index | String | The name of the shard's index.
primary | Boolean | Whether to provide an explanation for the primary shard (true) or its first replica (false), which share the same shard ID.
shard | Integer | The shard ID that you want an explanation for.
