**Introduced 1.0**

Deletes a snapshot from a repository.

Deleting a snapshot that is in progress stops the snapshot operation and deletes the partially created snapshot.

{% capture step1_rest %}
DELETE /_snapshot/my-opensearch-repo/my-first-snapshot
{% endcapture %}

{% capture step1_python %}


response = client.snapshot.delete(
  repository = "my-opensearch-repo",
