## Create snapshot

Creates a snapshot within an existing repository.

* To learn more about snapshots, see [Snapshots]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/snapshots/index).

* To view a list of your repositories, see [Get snapshot repository]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/snapshots/get-snapshot-repository).

### Path and HTTP methods

```json
PUT /_snapshot/<repository>/<snapshot>
POST /_snapshot/<repository>/<snapshot>
```

### Path parameters

Parameter | Data type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
repository | String | Repostory name to contain the snapshot. |
snapshot | String | Name of Snapshot to create. |

### Query parameters

Parameter | Data type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
wait_for_completion | Boolean |  Whether to wait for snapshot creation to complete before continuing. If you include this parameter, the snapshot definition is returned after completion. |

### Request fields

The request body is optional.

Field | Data type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
`indices` | String | The indices you want to include in the snapshot. You can use `,` to create a list of indices, `*` to specify an index pattern, and `-` to exclude certain indices. Don't put spaces between items. Default is all indices.
`ignore_unavailable` | Boolean | If an index from the `indices` list doesn't exist, whether to ignore it rather than fail the snapshot. Default is false.
`include_global_state` | Boolean | Whether to include cluster state in the snapshot. Default is true.
`partial` | Boolean | Whether to allow partial snapshots. Default is false, which fails the entire snapshot if one or more shards fails to stor

#### Example requests

##### Request without a body

The following request creates a snapshot called `my-first-snapshot` in an S3 repository called `my-s3-repository`. A request body is not included because it is optional.

```json
POST _snapshot/my-s3-repository/my-first-snapshot
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

##### Request with a body

You can also add a request body to include or exclude certain indices or specify other settings:

```json
PUT _snapshot/my-s3-repository/2
{
  "indices": "opensearch-dashboards*,my-index*,-my-index-2016",
  "ignore_unavailable": true,
  "include_global_state": false,
  "partial": false
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

#### Example responses

Upon success, the response content depends on whether you include the `wait_for_completion` query parameter.

##### `wait_for_completion` not included

```json
{
  "accepted": true
}
```

To verify that the snapshot was created, use the [Get snapshot]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/snapshots/get-snapshot) API, passing the snapshot name as the `snapshot` path parameter.
{: .note}

##### `wait_for_completion` included

The snapshot definition is returned.
