# Nodes stats

The nodes stats API returns statistics about your cluster.

## Path and HTTP methods

```json
GET /_nodes/stats
GET /_nodes/<node_id>/stats
GET /_nodes/stats/<metric>
GET /_nodes/<node_id>/stats/<metric>
GET /_nodes/stats/<metric>/<index_metric>
GET /_nodes/<node_id>/stats/<metric>/<index_metric>
```

## Path parameters

The following table lists the available path parameters. All path parameters are optional.

Parameter | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
nodeId | String | A comma-separated list of nodeIds used to filter results. Supports [node filters]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/nodes-apis/index/#node-filters). Defaults to `_all`.
metric | String | A comma-separated list of metric groups that will be included in the response. For example, `jvm,fs`. See the list of all metrics below. Defaults to all metrics.
index_metric | String | A comma-separated list of index metric groups that will be included in the response. For example, `docs,store`. See the list of all index metrics below. Defaults to all index metrics.

The following table lists all available metric groups.

Metric | Description
:--- |:----
indices | Index statistics, such as size, document count, and search, index, and delete times for documents.
os | Statistics about the host OS, including load, memory, and swapping.
process | Statistics about processes, including their memory consumption, open file descriptors, and CPU usage.
jvm | Statistics about the JVM, including memory pool, buffer pool, and garbage collection, and the number of loaded classes.
fs | File system statistics, such as read/write statistics, data path, and free disk space.
transport | Transport layer statistics about send/receive in cluster communication.
http | Statistics about the HTTP layer.
breaker | Statistics about the field data circuit breakers.
script | Statistics about scripts, such as compilations and cache evictions. 
discovery | Statistics about cluster states.
ingest | Statistics about ingest pipelines.
adaptive_selection | Statistics about adaptive replica selection, which selects an eligible node using shard allocation awareness.
script_cache | Statistics about script cache.
indexing_pressure | Statistics about the node's indexing pressure.
shard_indexing_pressure | Statistics about shard indexing pressure.

To filter the information returned for the `indices` metric, you can use specific `index_metric` values. You can use these only when you use the following query types:

```json
GET _nodes/stats/
GET _nodes/stats/_all
GET _nodes/stats/indices
```

The following index metrics are supported:

- docs
- store
- indexing
- get
- search
- merge
- refresh
- flush
- warmer
- query_cache
- fielddata
- completion
- segments
- translog
- request_cache

For example, the following query requests statistics for `docs` and `search`:

```json
GET _nodes/stats/indices/docs,search
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Query parameters

The following table lists the available query parameters. All query parameters are optional.

Parameter | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
completion_fields | String | The fields to include in completion statistics. Supports comma-separated lists and wildcard expressions. 
fielddata_fields | String | The fields to include in fielddata statistics. Supports comma-separated lists and wildcard expressions. 
fields | String | The fields to include. Supports comma-separated lists and wildcard expressions. 
groups | String | A comma-separated list of search groups to include in the search statistics. 
level | String | Specifies whether statistics are aggregated at the cluster, index, or shard level. Valid values are `indices`, `node`, and `shard`.
timeout | Time | Sets the time limit for node response. Default is `30s`.
include_segment_file_sizes | Boolean | If segment statistics are requested, this field specifies to return the aggregated disk usage of every Lucene index file. Default is `false`.

total.current | Integer | The total number of documents that are currently being ingested by the node.
total.failed | Integer | The total number of failed ingestions for the node.
pipelines | Object | Ingest pipeline statistics for the node. Each pipeline is a nested object specified by its ID with the properties listed below.
pipelines._id_.count | Integer | The number of documents preprocessed by the ingest pipeline.
pipelines._id_.time_in_millis | Integer | The total amount of time for preprocessing documents in the ingest pipeline, in milliseconds.
pipelines._id_.failed | Integer | The total number of failed ingestions for the ingest pipeline.
pipelines._id_.processors | Array of objects | Statistics for the ingest processors. Includes the number of documents that are currently transformed, the total number of transformed documents, the number of failed transformations, and the time spent transforming documents.

### `adaptive_selection`

The `adaptive_selection` object contains the adaptive selection statistics. Each entry is specified by the node ID and has the properties listed below. 

Field | Field type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
outgoing_searches | Integer | The number of outgoing search requests for the node.
avg_queue_size | Integer | The rolling average queue size of search requests for the node (exponentially weighted).
avg_service_time_ns | Integer | The rolling average service time for search requests, in nanoseconds (exponentially weighted).
avg_response_time_ns | Integer | The rolling average response time for search requests, in nanoseconds (exponentially weighted).
rank | String | The node's rank that is used to select shards when routing requests.

### `indexing_pressure`

The `indexing_pressure` object contains the indexing pressure statistics and has the following properties.

Field | Field type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
memory | Object | Statistics related to memory consumption for the indexing load.
memory.current | Object | Statistics related to memory consumption for the current indexing load.
memory.current.combined_coordinating_and_primary_in_bytes | Integer | The total memory used by indexing requests in the coordinating or primary stages, in bytes. A node can reuse the coordinating memory if the primary stage is run locally, so the total memory does not necessarily equal the sum of the coordinating and primary stage memory usage.
memory.current.coordinating_in_bytes | The total memory consumed by indexing requests in the coordinating stage, in bytes.
memory.current.primary_in_bytes | Integer | The total memory consumed by indexing requests in the primary stage, in bytes.
memory.current.replica_in_bytes | Integer | The total memory consumed by indexing requests in the replica stage, in bytes.
memory.current.all_in_bytes | Integer | The total memory consumed by indexing requests in the coordinating, primary, or replica stages.

### `shard_indexing_pressure`

The `shard_indexing_pressure` object contains the [shard indexing pressure]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/shard-indexing-backpressure) statistics and has the following properties.

Field | Field type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
[stats]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/stats-api/) | Object | Statistics about shard indexing pressure.
total_rejections_breakup_shadow_mode | Object | If running in shadow mode, the `total_rejections_breakup_shadow_mode` object contains statistics about the request rejection criteria of all shards in the node.
total_rejections_breakup_shadow_mode.node_limits | Integer | The total number of rejections due to the node memory limit. When all shards reach the memory limit assigned to the node (for example, 10% of heap size), the shard is unable to take in more traffic on the node, and the indexing request is rejected.
total_rejections_breakup_shadow_mode.no_successful_request_limits | Integer | The total number of rejections when the node occupancy level is breaching its soft limit and the shard has multiple outstanding requests that are waiting to be executed. In this case, additional indexing requests are rejected until the system recovers.
total_rejections_breakup_shadow_mode.throughput_degradation_limits | Integer | The total number of rejections when the node occupancy level is breaching its soft limit and there is a constant deterioration in the request turnaround at the shard level. In this case, additional indexing requests are rejected until the system recovers.
enabled | Boolean | Specifies whether the shard indexing pressure feature is turned on for the node.
enforced | Boolean | If true, the shard indexing pressure runs in enforced mode (there are rejections). If false, the shard indexing pressure runs in shadow mode (there are no rejections, but statistics are recorded and can be retrieved in the `total_rejections_breakup_shadow_mode` object). Only applicable if shard indexing pressure is enabled.
