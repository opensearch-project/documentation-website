# List APIs
**Introduced 2.18**
{: .label .label-purple }

The List API retrieves statistics about indexes and shards in a paginated format. This streamlines the task of processing responses that include many indexes.

The List API supports two operations:

- [List indices]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/list/list-indices/)
- [List shards]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/list/list-shards/)

## Shared query parameters

All List API operations support the following optional query parameters.

Parameter | Description
:--- | :--- |
`v` |  Provides verbose output by adding headers to the columns. It also adds some formatting to help align each of the columns. All examples in this section include the `v` parameter.
`help` | Lists the default and other available headers for a given operation.
`h`  |  Limits the output to specific headers.
`format` |  The format in which to return the result. Valid values are `json`, `yaml`, `cbor`, and `smile`.
`s` | Sorts the output by the specified columns.

## Examples

The following examples show how to use the optional query parameters to customize all List API responses.


### Get verbose output

To query indexes and their statistics with a verbose output that includes all column headings in the response, use the `v` query parameter, as shown in the following example.

#### Request

```json
GET _list/indices?v
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

#### Response

```json
health status index           uuid    pri rep  docs.count  docs.deleted
green  open   .kibana_1 - - - -              
yellow open    sample-index-1 - - - -
next_token null
```


### Get all available headers

To see all the available headers, use the `help` parameter with the following syntax:

```json
GET _list/<operation_name>?help
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

#### Request

The following example list indices operation returns all the available headers:

```json
GET _list/indices?help
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

#### Response

The following example displays the indexes and their health status in a table:

```json
health     | h                              | current health status
status     | s                              | open/close status
index      | i,idx                          | index name
uuid       | id,uuid                        | index uuid
pri        | p,shards.primary,shardsPrimary | number of primary shards
rep        | r,shards.replica,shardsReplica | number of replica shards
docs.count | dc,docsCount                   | available docs
```

### Get a subset of headers

To limit the output to a subset of headers, use the `h` parameter with the following syntax:

```json
GET _list/<operation_name>?h=<header_name_1>,<header_name_2>&v
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

For any operation, you can determine which headers are available by using the `help` parameter and then using the `h` parameter to limit the output to only a subset of headers. 

#### Request

The following example limits the indexes in the response to only the index name and health status headers:

```json
GET _list/indices?h=health,index
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Response

```json
green  .kibana_1
yellow sample-index-1
next_token null
```


### Sort by a header

To sort the output on a single page by a header, use the `s` parameter with the following syntax:

```json
GET _list/<operation_name>?s=<header_name_1>,<header_name_2>
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

#### Request

The following example request sorts indexes by index name:

```json
GET _list/indices?s=h,i
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

#### Response

```json
green sample-index-2
yellow sample-index-1
next_token null
```

### Retrieve data in JSON format

By default, List APIs return data in a `text/plain` format. Other supported formats are [YAML](https://yaml.org/), [CBOR](https://cbor.io/), and [Smile](https://github.com/FasterXML/smile-format-specification).


To retrieve data in the JSON format, use the `format=json` parameter with the following syntax.

If you use the Security plugin, ensure you have the appropriate permissions.

#### Request

```json
GET _list/<operation_name>?format=json
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

#### Request

```json
GET _list/indices?format=json
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Response

The response contains data in JSON format:

```json
{"next_token":null,"indices":[{"health":"green","status":"-","index":".kibana_1","uuid":"-","pri":"-","rep":"-","docs.count":"-","docs.deleted":"-","store.size":"-","pri.store.size":"-"},{"health":"yellow","status":"-","index":"sample-index-1","uuid":"-","pri":"-","rep":"-","docs.count":"-","docs.deleted":"-","store.size":"-","pri.store.size":"-"}]}
```
