# List shards
**Introduced 2.18**
{: .label .label-purple }

The list shards operation outputs, in a paginated format, the state of all primary and replica shards and how they are distributed.

## Path and HTTP methods

```json
GET _list/shards
GET _list/shards/<index>
```

## Query parameters

All parameters are optional.

Parameter | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
`bytes` | Byte size | Specifies the byte size units, for example, `7kb` or `6gb`. For more information, see [Supported units]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/units/).
`local` | Boolean | Whether to return information from the local node only instead of from the cluster manager node. Default is `false`.
`cluster_manager_timeout` | Time | The amount of time to wait for a connection to the cluster manager node. Default is `30s`.
`cancel_after_time_interval` | Time | The amount of time after which the shard request is canceled. Default is `-1` (no timeout).
`time` | Time | Specifies the time units, for example, `5d` or `7h`. For more information, see [Supported units]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/units/).
`next_token` | String | Fetches the next page of indexes. When `null`, only provides the first page of indexes. Default is `null`.
`size` | Integer | The maximum number of indexes to be displayed on a single page. The number of indexes on a single page of the response is not always equal to the specified `size`. Default and minimum value is `2000`. Maximum value is `20000`.
`sort` | String | The order in which the indexes are displayed. If `desc`, then the most recently created indexes are displayed first. If `asc`, then the oldest indexes are displayed first. Default is `asc`.

When using the `next_token` path parameter, use the token produced by the response to see the next page of indexes. After the API returns `null`, all indexes contained in the API have been returned.

## Example requests

To get information for all the indexes and shards, use the following query and keep specifying the `next_token` as received from response until its `null`:

```json
GET _list/shards/<index>?v&next_token=token
```

To limit the information to a specific index, add the index name after your query, as shown in the following example and keep specifying the `next_token` as received from response until its `null`:

```json
GET _list/shards/<index>?v&next_token=token
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

If you want to get information for more than one index, separate the indexes with commas, as shown in the following example:

```json
GET _list/shards/index1,index2,index3?v&next_token=token
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Example response
