# Dangling indexes API

After a node joins a cluster, dangling indexes occur if any shards exist in the node's local directory that do not already exist in the cluster. Dangling indexes can be listed, deleted, or imported.

## Path and HTTP methods

List dangling indexes:

```
GET /_dangling
```

Import a dangling index:

```
POST /_dangling/<index-uuid>
```

Delete a dangling index:

```
DELETE /_dangling/<index-uuid>
```

## Path parameters

Path parameters are required.

Path parameter | Description
:--- | :---
index-uuid | UUID of index.

## Query parameters

Query parameters are optional.

Query parameter | Data type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
accept_data_loss | Boolean | Must be set to `true` for an `import` or `delete` because Opensearch is unaware of where the dangling index data came from.
timeout | Time units | The amount of time to wait for a response. If no response is received in the defined time period, an error is returned. Default is `30` seconds.
master_timeout | Time units | The amount of time to wait for the connection to the cluster manager. If no response is received in the defined time period, an error is returned. Default is `30` seconds.
