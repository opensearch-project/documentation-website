# Get index
Introduced 1.0
{: .label .label-purple }

You can use the get index API operation to return information about an index.

## Example

```json
GET /sample-index
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Path and HTTP methods

```
GET /<index-name>
```

## URL parameters

All parameters are optional.

Parameter | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---
allow_no_indices | Boolean | Whether to ignore wildcards that don't match any indices. Default is true.
expand_wildcards | String | Expands wildcard expressions to different indices. Combine multiple values with commas. Available values are all (match all indices), open (match open indices), closed (match closed indices), hidden (match hidden indices), and none (do not accept wildcard expressions), which must be used with open, closed, or both. Default is open.
flat_settings | Boolean | Whether to return settings in the flat form, which can improve readability, especially for heavily nested settings. For example, the flat form of "index": { "creation_date": "123456789" } is "index.creation_date": "123456789".
include_defaults | Boolean | Whether to include default settings as part of the response. This parameter is useful for identifying the names and current values of settings you want to update.
ignore_unavailable | Boolean | If true, OpenSearch does not include missing or closed indices in the response.
local | Boolean | Whether to return information from only the local node instead of from the master node. Default is false.
master_timeout | Time | How long to wait for a connection to the master node. Default is `30s`.
