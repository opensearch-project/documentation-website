# CAT segment replication
**Introduced 2.7**
{: .label .label-purple }

The CAT segment replication operation returns information about active and last completed [segment replication]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/segment-replication/index) events on each replica shard, including related shard-level metrics. These metrics provide information about how far behind the primary shard the replicas are lagging.

Call the CAT Segment Replication API only on indexes with segment replication enabled.

## Example requests

The following examples illustrate various segment replication responses.

### No active segment replication events

The following query requests segment replication metrics with column headings for all indexes:

```json
GET /_cat/segment_replication?v=true
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains the metrics for the preceding request:

```bash
shardId target_node target_host checkpoints_behind bytes_behind current_lag last_completed_lag rejected_requests
[index-1][0] runTask-1 127.0.0.1 0 0b 0s 7ms 0
```

###  Shard ID specified

The following query requests segment replication metrics with column headings for shards with the ID `0` from indexes `index1` and `index2`:

```json
GET /_cat/segment_replication/index1,index2?v=true&shards=0
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains the metrics for the preceding request. The column headings correspond to the metric names:

```bash
shardId target_node target_host checkpoints_behind bytes_behind current_lag last_completed_lag rejected_requests
[index-1][0] runTask-1 127.0.0.1 0 0b 0s 3ms 0
[index-2][0] runTask-1 127.0.0.1 0 0b 0s 5ms 0
```

###  Detailed response

The following query requests detailed segment replication metrics with column headings for all indexes:

```json
GET /_cat/segment_replication?v=true&detailed=true
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains additional metrics about the files and stages of a segment replication event:

```bash
shardId target_node target_host checkpoints_behind bytes_behind current_lag last_completed_lag rejected_requests stage time files_fetched files_percent bytes_fetched bytes_percent start_time stop_time files files_total bytes bytes_total replicating_stage_time_taken get_checkpoint_info_stage_time_taken file_diff_stage_time_taken get_files_stage_time_taken finalize_replication_stage_time_taken

```

###  Sorting the results

The following query requests segment replication metrics with column headings for all indexes, sorted by shard ID in descending order:

```json
GET /_cat/segment_replication?v&s=shardId:desc
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response contains the sorted results:

```bash
shardId    target_node  target_host checkpoints_behind bytes_behind current_lag last_completed_lag rejected_requests
[test6][1] runTask-2   127.0.0.1   0                  0b           0s          5ms                0
[test6][0] runTask-2   127.0.0.1   0                  0b           0s          4ms                0
```

### Using a metric alias 

In a request, you can either use a metric's full name or one of its aliases. The following query is the same as the preceding query, but it uses the alias `s` instead of `shardID` for sorting:

```json
GET /_cat/segment_replication?v&s=s:desc
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Example response metrics

The following table lists the response metrics that are returned for all requests. When referring to a metric in a query parameter, you can provide either the metric's full name or any of its aliases, as shown in the previous [example](#using-a-metric-alias).

Metric | Alias | Description

`shardId` | `s` | The ID of a specific shard.
