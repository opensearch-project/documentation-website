# CAT indices
Introduced 1.0
{: .label .label-purple }

The CAT indices operation lists information related to indices⁠—how much disk space they are using, how many shards they have, their health status, and so on.

## Example

```
GET _cat/indices?v
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

To limit the information to a specific index, add the index name after your query.

```
GET _cat/indices/<index>?v
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

If you want to get information for more than one index, separate the indices with commas:

```json
GET _cat/indices/index1,index2,index3
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Path and HTTP methods

```
GET _cat/indices/<index>
GET _cat/indices
```

## URL parameters

All CAT indices URL parameters are optional.

In addition to the [common URL parameters]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/cat/index), you can specify the following parameters:

Parameter | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :---

health | String | Limit indices based on their health status. Supported values are `green`, `yellow`, and `red`.
include_unloaded_segments | Boolean | Whether to include information from segments not loaded into memory. Default is false.
