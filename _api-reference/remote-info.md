# Remote cluster information
Introduced 1.0
{: .label .label-purple }

This operation provides connection information for any remote OpenSearch clusters that you've configured for the local cluster, such as the remote cluster alias, connection mode (`sniff` or `proxy`), IP addresses for seed nodes, and timeout settings.

The response is more comprehensive and useful than a call to `_cluster/settings`, which only includes the cluster alias and seed nodes.


## Path and HTTP methods

```
