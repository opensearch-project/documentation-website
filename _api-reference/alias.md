# Alias
Introduced 1.0
{: .label .label-purple }

An alias is a virtual pointer that you can use to reference one or more indices. Creating and updating aliases are atomic operations, so you can reindex your data and point an alias at it without any downtime.


## Example

```json
POST _aliases
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "add": {
        "index": "movies",
        "alias": "movies-alias1"
      }
    },
    {
      "remove": {
        "index": "old-index",
        "alias": "old-index-alias"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}
