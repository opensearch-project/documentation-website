# REST API reference

OpenSearch uses its REST API for most operations. This _incomplete_ section includes REST API paths, HTTP verbs, supported parameters, request body details, and example responses.

In general, the OpenSearch REST API is no different from the Elasticsearch OSS REST API; most client code that worked with Elasticsearch OSS should also work with OpenSearch.
