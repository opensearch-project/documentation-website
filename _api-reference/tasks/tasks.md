# Tasks
**Introduced 1.0**
{: .label .label-purple }

A task is any operation you run in a cluster. For example, searching your data collection of books for a title or author name is a task. When you run OpenSearch, a task is automatically created to monitor your cluster's health and performance. For more information about all of the tasks currently executing in your cluster, you can use the `tasks` API operation.

## Attaching headers to tasks

To associate requests with tasks for better tracking, you can provide a `X-Opaque-Id:<ID_number>` header as part of the HTTPS request reader of your `curl` command. The API will attach the specified header in the returned result.

Usage:

```bash
curl -i -H "X-Opaque-Id: 111111" "https://localhost:9200/_tasks" -u 'admin:<custom-admin-password>' --insecure
```

The `_tasks` operation returns the following result.

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Opaque-Id: 111111
content-type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
content-length: 768

            "X-Opaque-Id": "111111"
          }
        },
        "Mgqdm0r9SEGClWxp_RbnaQ:30071": {
          "node": "Mgqdm0r9SEGClWxp_RbnaQ",
          "id": 30071,
          "type": "transport",

          "cancellable": false,
          "headers": {
            "X-Opaque-Id": "111111"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
This operation supports the same parameters as the `tasks` operation. The following example shows how you can associate `X-Opaque-Id` with specific tasks:

```bash
curl -i -H "X-Opaque-Id: 123456" "https://localhost:9200/_tasks?nodes=opensearch-node1" -u 'admin:<custom-admin-password>' --insecure
```
