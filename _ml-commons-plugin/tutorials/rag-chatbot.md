# RAG chatbot

One of the known limitations of large language models (LLMs) is that their knowledge base only contains information from the period of time during which they were trained. LLMs have no knowledge of recent events or of your internal data. You can augment the LLM knowledge base by using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

This tutorial illustrates how to build your own chatbot using [agents and tools](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/index/) and RAG. RAG supplements the LLM knowledge base with information contained in OpenSearch indexes.

Replace the placeholders beginning with the prefix `your_` with your own values.
{: .note}

## Prerequisite

Meet the prerequisite and follow Step 1 of the [RAG with a conversational flow agent tutorial]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/tutorials/rag-conversational-agent/) to set up the `test_population_data` knowledge base index, which contains US city population data.

Note the embedding model ID; you'll use it in the following steps. 

## Step 1: Set up a knowledge base

First, create an ingest pipeline:

```json
PUT /_ingest/pipeline/test_tech_news_pipeline
{
    "description": "text embedding pipeline for tech news",
    "processors": [
        {
            "text_embedding": {
                "model_id": "your_text_embedding_model_id",
                "field_map": {
                    "passage": "passage_embedding"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Next, create an index named `test_tech_news`, which contains recent tech news:

```json
PUT test_tech_news
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "passage": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "passage_embedding": {
        "type": "knn_vector",
        "dimension": 384
      }
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "knn.space_type": "cosinesimil",
      "default_pipeline": "test_tech_news_pipeline",
      "knn": "true"
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Ingest data into the index:

```json
POST _bulk
{"index":{"_index":"test_tech_news"}}

{"passage":"LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a family of autoregressive large language models (LLMs), released by Meta AI starting in February 2023.\n\nFor the first version of LLaMA, four model sizes were trained: 7, 13, 33, and 65 billion parameters. LLaMA's developers reported that the 13B parameter model's performance on most NLP benchmarks exceeded that of the much larger GPT-3 (with 175B parameters) and that the largest model was competitive with state of the art models such as PaLM and Chinchilla.[1] Whereas the most powerful LLMs have generally been accessible only through limited APIs (if at all), Meta released LLaMA's model weights to the research community under a noncommercial license.[2] Within a week of LLaMA's release, its weights were leaked to the public on 4chan via BitTorrent.[3]\n\nIn July 2023, Meta released several models as Llama 2, using 7, 13 and 70 billion parameters.\n\nLLaMA-2\n\nOn July 18, 2023, in partnership with Microsoft, Meta announced LLaMA-2, the next generation of LLaMA. Meta trained and released LLaMA-2 in three model sizes: 7, 13, and 70 billion parameters.[4] The model architecture remains largely unchanged from that of LLaMA-1 models, but 40% more data was used to train the foundational models.[5] The accompanying preprint[5] also mentions a model with 34B parameters that might be released in the future upon satisfying safety targets.\n\nLLaMA-2 includes both foundational models and models fine-tuned for dialog, called LLaMA-2 Chat. In further departure from LLaMA-1, all models are released with weights, and are free for many commercial use cases. However, due to some remaining restrictions, the description of LLaMA as open source has been disputed by the Open Source Initiative (known for maintaining the Open Source Definition).[6]\n\nIn November 2023, research conducted by Patronus AI, an artificial intelligence startup company, compared performance of LLaMA-2, OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-4-Turbo, and Anthropic's Claude2 on two versions of a 150-question test about information in SEC filings (e.g. Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, Form 8-K, earnings reports, earnings call transcripts) submitted by public companies to the agency where one version of the test required the generative AI models to use a retrieval system to locate the specific SEC filing to answer the questions while the other version provided the specific SEC filing to the models to answer the question (i.e. in a long context window). On the retrieval system version, GPT-4-Turbo and LLaMA-2 both failed to produce correct answers to 81% of the questions, while on the long context window version, GPT-4-Turbo and Claude-2 failed to produce correct answers to 21% and 24% of the questions respectively.[7][8]"}

## Step 2: Prepare an LLM

Follow [step 2 of the RAG with a conversational flow agent tutorial]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/tutorials/rag-conversational-agent/#step-2-prepare-an-llm) to configure the Amazon Bedrock Claude model.

Note the model ID; you'll use it in the following steps.

## Step 3: Create an agent

For this tutorial, you will create an agent of the `conversational` type. 

Both the `conversational_flow` and `conversational` agents support conversation history.

The `conversational_flow` and `conversational` agents differ in the following ways:

- A `conversational_flow` agent runs tools sequentially, in a predefined order.
- A `conversational` agent dynamically chooses which tool to run next.

In this tutorial, the agent includes two tools: One provides recent population data, and the other contains tech news.

The agent has the following parameters:

- `"max_iteration": 5`: The agent runs the LLM a maximum of five times.
- `"response_filter": "$.completion"`: Needed to retrieve the LLM answer from the Amazon Bedrock Claude model response.
- `"doc_size": 3` (in `population_data_knowledge_base`): Specifies to return the top three documents.

Create an agent with the preceding specifications:

```json
POST _plugins/_ml/agents/_register
{
  "name": "Chat Agent with RAG",
  "type": "conversational",
  "description": "this is a test agent",
  "llm": {
    "model_id": "your_llm_model_id",
    "parameters": {
      "max_iteration": 5,
      "response_filter": "$.completion"
    }
  },
  "memory": {
    "type": "conversation_index"
  },
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "VectorDBTool",
      "name": "population_data_knowledge_base",
      "description": "This tool provides population data of US cities.",
      "parameters": {
        "input": "${parameters.question}",
        "index": "test_population_data",
        "source_field": [
          "population_description"
        ],
        "model_id": "your_text_embedding_model_id",
        "embedding_field": "population_description_embedding",
        "doc_size": 3
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "VectorDBTool",
      "name": "tech_news_knowledge_base",
      "description": "This tool provides recent tech news.",
      "parameters": {
        "input": "${parameters.question}",
        "index": "test_tech_news",
        "source_field": [
          "passage"
        ],
        "model_id": "your_text_embedding_model_id",
        "embedding_field": "passage_embedding",
        "doc_size": 2
      }
    }
  ],
  "app_type": "chat_with_rag"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Note the agent ID; you'll use it in the next step.

## Step 4: Test the agent

The `conversational` agent supports a `verbose` option. You can set `verbose` to `true` to obtain detailed steps.

Alternatively, you can call the [Get Message Traces API](ml-commons-plugin/api/memory-apis/get-message-traces/):

```json
GET _plugins/_ml/memory/message/message_id/traces
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Start a conversation

Ask a question related to tech news:

```json
POST _plugins/_ml/agents/your_agent_id/_execute
{
  "parameters": {
    "question": "What's vision pro",
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

In the response, note that the agent runs the `tech_news_knowledge_base` tool to obtain the top two documents. The agent then passes these documents as context to the LLM. The LLM uses the context to produce the answer:

```json
{
  "inference_results": [
    {
      "output": [
        {

### Continue a conversation

To continue a previous conversation, provide its conversation ID in the `memory_id` parameter:
