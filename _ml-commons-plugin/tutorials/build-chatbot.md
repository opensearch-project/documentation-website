# Build your own chatbot

This is an experimental feature and is not recommended for use in a production environment. For updates on the progress of the feature or if you want to leave feedback, see the associated [GitHub issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons/issues/1161).    
{: .warning}

Sometimes a large language model (LLM) cannot answer a question right away. For example, an LLM can't tell you how many errors there are in your log index for last week because its knowledge base does not contain your proprietary data. In this case, you need to provide additional information to an LLM in a subsequent call. You can use an agent to solve such complex problems. The agent can run tools to obtain more information from configured data sources and send the additional information to the LLM as context.

This tutorial describes how to build your own chatbot in OpenSearch using a `conversational` agent. For more information about agents, see [Agents and tools]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/index/).

Replace the placeholders starting with the prefix `your_` with your own values.
{: .note}

## Prerequisite

Log in to the OpenSearch Dashboards home page, select **Add sample data**, and add the **Sample eCommerce orders** data.

## Step 1: Configure a knowledge base

Meet the prerequisite and follow Step 1 of the [RAG with a conversational flow agent tutorial]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/tutorials/rag-conversational-agent/) to configure the `test_population_data` knowledge base index, which contains US city population data.

Create an ingest pipeline:

```json
PUT /_ingest/pipeline/test_stock_price_data_pipeline
{
  "description": "text embedding pipeline",
  "processors": [
    {
      "text_embedding": {
        "model_id": "your_text_embedding_model_id",
        "field_map": {
          "stock_price_history": "stock_price_history_embedding"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Create the `test_stock_price_data` index, which contains historical stock price data:

```json
PUT test_stock_price_data
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "stock_price_history": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "stock_price_history_embedding": {
        "type": "knn_vector",
        "dimension": 384
      }
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "knn.space_type": "cosinesimil",
      "default_pipeline": "test_stock_price_data_pipeline",
      "knn": "true"
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Ingest data into the index:

```json

## Step 2: Prepare an LLM

This tutorial uses the [Amazon Bedrock Claude model](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/). You can also use other LLMs. For more information, see [Connecting to externally hosted models]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/remote-models/index/).

Create a connector for the model:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/connectors/_create
{
  "name": "BedRock Claude instant-v1 Connector ",
  "description": "The connector to BedRock service for claude model",
  "version": 1,
  "protocol": "aws_sigv4",
  "parameters": {
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "service_name": "bedrock",
    "anthropic_version": "bedrock-2023-05-31",
    "max_tokens_to_sample": 8000,
    "temperature": 0.0001,
    "response_filter": "$.completion",
    "stop_sequences": ["\n\nHuman:","\nObservation:","\n\tObservation:","\nObservation","\n\tObservation","\n\nQuestion"]
  },
  "credential": {
    "access_key": "your_aws_access_key",
    "secret_key": "your_aws_secret_key",
    "session_token": "your_aws_session_token"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_type": "predict",
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "https://bedrock-runtime.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/model/anthropic.claude-instant-v1/invoke",
      "headers": {
        "content-type": "application/json",
        "x-amz-content-sha256": "required"
      },
      "request_body": "{\"prompt\":\"${parameters.prompt}\", \"stop_sequences\": ${parameters.stop_sequences}, \"max_tokens_to_sample\":${parameters.max_tokens_to_sample}, \"temperature\":${parameters.temperature},  \"anthropic_version\":\"${parameters.anthropic_version}\" }"
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Note the connector ID; you'll use it to register the model.

Register the model:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/_register
{
    "name": "Bedrock Claude Instant model",
    "function_name": "remote",
    "description": "Bedrock Claude instant-v1 model",
    "connector_id": "your_connector_id"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Note the LLM model ID; you'll use it in the following steps.

Deploy the model:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/your_LLM_model_id/_deploy
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Test the model:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/your_LLM_model_id/_predict
{
  "parameters": {
    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: how are you? \n\nAssistant:"
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

## Step 3: Create an agent with the default prompt

Next, create and test an agent.

### Create an agent

Create an agent of the `conversational` type. 

The agent is configured with the following information:

- Meta information: `name`, `type`, `description`.
- LLM information: The agent uses an LLM to reason and select the next step, including choosing an appropriate tool and preparing the tool input.
- Tools: A tool is a function that can be executed by the agent. Each tool can define its own `name`, `description`, and `parameters`.
- Memory: Stores chat messages. Currently, OpenSearch only supports one memory type: `conversation_index`.

The agent contains the following parameters:

- `conversational`: This agent type has a built-in prompt. To override it with your own prompt, see [Step 4](#step-4-optional-create-an-agent-with-a-custom-prompt).
- `app_type`: Specify this parameter for reference purposes in order to differentiate between multiple agents.
- `llm`: Defines the LLM configuration:
   - `"max_iteration": 5`:  The agent runs the LLM a maximum of five times.
   - `"response_filter": "$.completion"`: Needed to retrieve the LLM answer from the Bedrock Claude model response.
   - `"message_history_limit": 5`: The agent retrieves a maximum of the five most recent historical messages and adds them to the LLM context. Set this parameter to `0` to omit message history in the context.
   - `disable_trace`: If `true`, then the agent does not store trace data in memory. Trace data is included in each message and provides a detailed recount of steps performed while generating the message.
- `memory`: Defines how to store messages. Currently, OpenSearch only supports the `conversation_index` memory, which stores messages in a memory index.
- Tools: 
   - An LLM will reason to decide which tool to run and will prepare the tool's input. 
   - To include the tool's output in the response, specify `"include_output_in_agent_response": true`. In this tutorial, you will include the `PPLTool` output in the response (see the example response in [Test the agent](#test-the-agent)). 
   - By default, the tool's `name` is the same as the tool's `type`, and each tool has a default description. You can override the tool's `name` and `description`.
   - Each tool in the `tools` list must have a unique name. For example, the following demo agent defines two tools of the `VectorDBTool` type with different names (`population_data_knowledge_base` and `stock_price_data_knowledge_base`). Each tool has a custom description so that the LLM can easily understand what the tool does.
   
   For more information about tools, see [Tools]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/tools/index/).

This example request configures several sample tools in an agent. You can configure other tools that are relevant to your use case as needed.

### Test the agent

Note the following testing tips: 

- You can view the detailed steps of an agent execution in one of the following ways:
   - Enable verbose mode: `"verbose": true`.
   - Call the Get Trace API: `GET _plugins/_ml/memory/message/your_message_id/traces`.

- An LLM may hallucinate. It may choose the wrong tool to solve your problem, especially when you have configured many tools. To avoid hallucinations, try the following options:
   - Avoid configuring many tools in an agent.
   - Provide a detailed tool description clarifying what the tool can do. 
   - Specify the tool to use in the LLM question, for example, `Can you use the PPLTool to query the opensearch_dashboards_sample_data_ecommerce index so it can calculate how many orders were placed last week?`.
   - Specify the tool to use when executing an agent. For example, specify that only `PPLTool` and `CatIndexTool` should be used to process the current request.

Test the agent:

```json
POST _plugins/_ml/agents/your_agent_id/_execute
{
    "parameters": {
    "question": "Can you query with index opensearch_dashboards_sample_data_ecommerce to calculate how many orders in last week?",
    "verbose": false,
    "selected_tools": ["PPLTool", "CatIndexTool"]
    }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

<!-- vale off -->
#### Test the PPLTool
<!-- vale on -->

```json
POST _plugins/_ml/agents/your_agent_id/_execute
{
  "parameters": {
    "question": "Can you query with index opensearch_dashboards_sample_data_ecommerce to calculate how many orders in last week?",
    "verbose": false
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Because you specified `"include_output_in_agent_response": true` for the `PPLTool`, the response contains `PPLTool.output` in the `additional_info` object:

```json
{
  "inference_results": [
    {

## Step 4 (Optional): Create an agent with a custom prompt 

All agents have the following default prompt:

```json
"prompt": """

Human:${parameters.prompt.prefix}

${parameters.prompt.suffix}

Human: follow RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS

Assistant:"""
```

The prompt consists of two parts:

- `${parameters.prompt.prefix}`: A prompt prefix that describes what the AI assistant can do. You can change this parameter based on your use case, for example, `You are a professional data analyst. You will always answer questions based on the tool response first. If you don't know the answer, just say you don't know.`
- `${parameters.prompt.suffix}`: The main part of the prompt that defines the tools, chat history, prompt format instructions, a question, and a scratchpad. 

The default `prompt.suffix` is the following:

```json
"prompt.suffix": """Human:TOOLS
------
Assistant can ask Human to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the users original question. The tool response will be listed in "TOOL RESPONSE of {tool name}:". If TOOL RESPONSE is enough to answer human's question, Assistant should avoid rerun the same tool. 
Assistant should NEVER suggest run a tool with same input if it's already in TOOL RESPONSE. 
The tools the human can use are:

${parameters.tool_descriptions}

${parameters.chat_history}

${parameters.prompt.format_instruction}


Human:USER'S INPUT
--------------------
Here is the user's input :
${parameters.question}

${parameters.scratchpad}"""
```

The `prompt.suffix` consists of the following placeholders:

- `${parameters.tool_descriptions}`: This placeholder will be filled with the agent's tool information: the tool name and description. If you omit this placeholder, the agent will not use any tools.
- `${parameters.prompt.format_instruction}`: This placeholder defines the LLM response format. This placeholder is critical, and we do not recommend removing it.
- `${parameters.chat_history}`: This placeholder will be filled with the message history of the current memory. If you don't set the `memory_id` when you run the agent, or if there are no history messages, then this placeholder will be empty. If you don't need chat history, you can remove this placeholder.
- `${parameters.question}`: This placeholder will be filled with the user question.
- `${parameters.scratchpad}`: This placeholder will be filled with the detailed agent execution steps. These steps are the same as those you can view by specifying verbose mode or obtaining trace data (see an example in [Test the agent](#test-the-agent)). This placeholder is critical in order for the LLM to reason and select the next step based on the outcome of the previous steps. We do not recommend removing this placeholder.

### Custom prompt examples

The following examples demonstrate how to customize the prompt.

#### Example 1: Customize `prompt.prefix`

Register an agent with a custom `prompt.prefix`:

```json
POST _plugins/_ml/agents/_register
{
  "name": "Chat Agent with Custom Prompt",
  "type": "conversational",
  "description": "this is a test agent",
  "app_type": "os_chat",
  "llm": {
    "model_id": "P0L8xI0Bn3OCesyvPsif",
    "parameters": {
      "max_iteration": 3,
      "response_filter": "$.completion",
      "prompt.prefix": "Assistant is a professional data analyst. You will always answer question based on the tool response first. If you don't know the answer, just say don't know.\n"
    }
  },
  "memory": {
    "type": "conversation_index"
  },
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "VectorDBTool",
      "name": "population_data_knowledge_base",
      "description": "This tool provide population data of US cities.",
      "parameters": {
        "input": "${parameters.question}",
        "index": "test_population_data",
        "source_field": [
          "population_description"
        ],
        "model_id": "xkJLyI0Bn3OCesyvf94S",
        "embedding_field": "population_description_embedding",
        "doc_size": 3
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "VectorDBTool",
      "name": "stock_price_data_knowledge_base",
      "description": "This tool provide stock price data.",
      "parameters": {
        "input": "${parameters.question}",
        "index": "test_stock_price_data",
        "source_field": [
          "stock_price_history"
        ],
        "model_id": "xkJLyI0Bn3OCesyvf94S",
        "embedding_field": "stock_price_history_embedding",
        "doc_size": 3
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Test the agent:

```json
POST _plugins/_ml/agents/o0LDyI0Bn3OCesyvr-Zq/_execute
{
  "parameters": {
    "question": "What's the stock price increase of Amazon from May 2023 to Feb 2023?",
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

#### Example 2: OpenAI model with a custom prompt

Create a connector for the OpenAI `gpt-3.5-turbo` model:

```json
POST _plugins/_ml/connectors/_create
{
  "name": "My openai connector: gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "description": "The connector to openai chat model",
  "version": 1,
  "protocol": "http",
  "parameters": {
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "response_filter": "$.choices[0].message.content",
    "stop": ["\n\nHuman:","\nObservation:","\n\tObservation:","\n\tObservation","\n\nQuestion"],
    "system_instruction": "You are an Assistant which can answer kinds of questions."
  },
  "credential": {
    "openAI_key": "your_openAI_key"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_type": "predict",
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${credential.openAI_key}"
      },
      "request_body": "{ \"model\": \"${parameters.model}\", \"messages\": [{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"${parameters.system_instruction}\"},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"${parameters.prompt}\"}] }"
    }
  ]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Create a model using the connector ID from the response:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/_register?deploy=true
{
    "name": "My OpenAI model",
    "function_name": "remote",
    "description": "test model",
    "connector_id": "your_connector_id"
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Note the model ID and test the model by calling the Predict API:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/your_openai_model_id/_predict
{
  "parameters": {
    "system_instruction": "You are an Assistant which can answer kinds of questions.",
    "prompt": "hello"
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Create an agent with a custom `system_instruction` and `prompt`. The `prompt` customizes the `tool_descriptions`, `chat_history`, `format_instruction`, `question`, and `scratchpad` placeholders:

```json
POST _plugins/_ml/agents/_register
{
  "name": "My Chat Agent with OpenAI GPT 3.5",
  "type": "conversational",
  "description": "this is a test agent",
  "app_type": "os_chat",

{% include copy-curl.html %}

Note the agent ID from the response and test the model by running the agent:

```json
POST _plugins/_ml/agents/your_agent_id/_execute
{
  "parameters": {
    "question": "What's the stock price increase of Amazon from May 2023 to Feb 2023?",
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Test the agent by asking a question that requires the agent to use both configured tools:

```json
POST _plugins/_ml/agents/your_agent_id/_execute
{
  "parameters": {
    "question": "What's the population increase of Seattle from 2021 to 2023? Then check what's the stock price increase of Amazon from May 2023 to Feb 2023?",
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The response shows that the agent runs both the `population_data_knowledge_base` and `stock_price_data_knowledge_base` tools to obtain the answer:

## Step 5: Configure a root chatbot agent in OpenSearch Dashboards

To use the [OpenSearch Assistant for OpenSearch Dashboards]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/dashboards/dashboards-assistant/index/), you need to configure a root chatbot agent.

A root chatbot agent consists of the following parts:

- A `conversational` agent: Within the `AgentTool`, you can use any `conversational` agent created in the previous steps.
- An `MLModelTool`: This tool is used for suggesting new questions based on your current question and the model response.

Configure a root agent:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/agents/_register
{
  "name": "Chatbot agent",
  "type": "flow",
  "description": "this is a test chatbot agent",
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "AgentTool",
      "name": "LLMResponseGenerator",
      "parameters": {
        "agent_id": "your_conversational_agent_created_in_prevous_steps" 
      },
      "include_output_in_agent_response": true
    },
    {
      "type": "MLModelTool",
      "name": "QuestionSuggestor",
      "description": "A general tool to answer any question",
      "parameters": {
        "model_id": "your_llm_model_id_created_in_previous_steps",  
        "prompt": "Human:  You are an AI that only speaks JSON. Do not write normal text. Output should follow example JSON format: \n\n {\"response\": [\"question1\", \"question2\"]}\n\n. \n\nHuman:You will be given a chat history between OpenSearch Assistant and a Human.\nUse the context provided to generate follow up questions the Human would ask to the Assistant.\nThe Assistant can answer general questions about logs, traces and metrics.\nAssistant can access a set of tools listed below to answer questions given by the Human:\nQuestion suggestions generator tool\nHere's the chat history between the human and the Assistant.\n${parameters.LLMResponseGenerator.output}\nUse the following steps to generate follow up questions Human may ask after the response of the Assistant:\nStep 1.

Use the above context and generate follow up questions.Step4:You are an AI that only speaks JSON. Do not write normal text. Output should follow example JSON format: \n\n {\"response\": [\"question1\", \"question2\"]} \n \n----------------\n\nAssistant:"
      },
      "include_output_in_agent_response": true
    }
  ],
  "memory": {
    "type": "conversation_index"
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Note the root chatbot agent ID, log in to your OpenSearch server, go to the OpenSearch config folder (`$OS_HOME/config`), and run the following command:

```bashx
 curl -k --cert ./kirk.pem --key ./kirk-key.pem -X PUT https://localhost:9200/.plugins-ml-config/_doc/os_chat -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
 {
   "type":"os_chat_root_agent",
   "configuration":{
     "agent_id": "your_root_chatbot_agent_id"
   }
 }'
```
{% include copy.html %}

Go to your OpenSearch Dashboards config folder (`$OSD_HOME/config`) and edit `opensearch_dashboards.yml` by adding the following line to the end of the file: `assistant.chat.enabled: true`.

Restart OpenSearch Dashboards and then select the chat icon in the upper-right corner, shown in the following image.

<img width="300" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/dashboards/os-assistant-icon.png" alt="OpenSearch Assistant icon">

You can now chat in OpenSearch Dashboards, as shown in the following image.
