# Agents
**Introduced 2.13**
{: .label .label-purple }

An _agent_ is a coordinator that uses a large language model (LLM) to solve a problem. After the LLM reasons and decides what action to take, the agent coordinates the action execution. OpenSearch supports the following agent types:

- [_Flow agent_]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/agents/flow/): Runs tools sequentially, in the order specified in its configuration. The workflow of a flow agent is fixed. Useful for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- [_Conversational flow agent_]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/agents/conversational-flow/): Runs tools sequentially, in the order specified in its configuration. The workflow of a conversational flow agent is fixed. Stores conversation history so that users can ask follow-up questions. Useful for creating a chatbot.
- [_Conversational agent_]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/agents/conversational/): Reasons in order to provide a response based on the available knowledge, including the LLM knowledge base and a set of tools provided to the LLM. The LLM reasons iteratively to decide what action to take until it obtains the final answer or reaches the iteration limit. Stores conversation history so that users can ask follow-up questions. The workflow of a conversational agent is variable, based on follow-up questions. For specific questions, uses the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process to select the best tool from the configured tools for providing a response to the question. Useful for creating a chatbot that employs RAG.
- [_Plan-execute-reflect agent_]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/agents/plan-execute-reflect/): Dynamically plans, executes, and refines multi-step workflows to solve complex tasks. Internally, a plan-execute-reflect agent uses a conversational agent to execute each individual step in the plan. The agent automatically selects the most appropriate tool for each step based on tool descriptions and context. Ideal for long-running, exploratory processes that benefit from iterative reasoning and adaptive execution. Useful for conducting research or performing root cause analysis (RCA).

## Hidden agents
**Introduced 2.13**
{: .label .label-purple }

To hide agent details from end users, including the cluster admin, you can register a _hidden_ agent. If an agent is hidden, non-superadmin users don't have permission to call any [Agent APIs]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/api/agent-apis/index/), except for the [Execute API]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/api/agent-apis/execute-agent/), on the agent.

Only superadmin users can register a hidden agent. To register a hidden agent, you first need to authenticate with an [admin certificate]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security/configuration/tls/#configuring-admin-certificates):

```bash
curl -k --cert ./kirk.pem --key ./kirk-key.pem -XGET 'https://localhost:9200/.opendistro_security/_search'
```
{% include copy.html %}

All agents created by a superadmin user are automatically registered as hidden. Only the superadmin user can view hidden agent details and delete hidden agents.
To register a hidden agent, send a request to the `_register` endpoint:

```bash
curl -k --cert ./kirk.pem --key ./kirk-key.pem -X POST 'https://localhost:9200/_plugins/_ml/agents/_register' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
