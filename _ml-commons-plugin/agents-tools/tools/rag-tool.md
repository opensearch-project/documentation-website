# RAG tool
**Introduced 2.13**
{: .label .label-purple }
<!-- vale on -->

The `RAGTool` performs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). For more information about RAG, see [Conversational search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/conversational-search/).

RAG calls a large language model (LLM) and supplements its knowledge by providing relevant OpenSearch documents along with the user question. To retrieve relevant documents from an OpenSearch index, you'll need a text embedding model that facilitates vector search.

The RAG tool supports the following search methods:

- [Neural search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/neural-search/): Dense vector retrieval, which uses a text embedding model.
- [Neural sparse search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/neural-sparse-search/): Sparse vector retrieval, which uses a sparse encoding model.

## Before you start

To register and deploy a text embedding model and an LLM and ingest data into an index, perform Steps 1--5 of the [Agents and tools tutorial]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/agents-tools-tutorial/).

The following example uses neural search. To configure neural sparse search and deploy a sparse encoding model, see [Neural sparse search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/neural-sparse-search/).

## Step 1: Register a flow agent that will run the RAGTool
<!-- vale on -->

A flow agent runs a sequence of tools in order and returns the last tool's output. To create a flow agent, send the following request, providing the text embedding model ID in the `embedding_model_id` parameter and the LLM model ID in the `inference_model_id` parameter:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/agents/_register
{
  "name": "Test_Agent_For_RagTool",
  "type": "flow",
  "description": "this is a test flow agent",
  "tools": [
  {
    "type": "RAGTool",
    "description": "A description of the tool",
    "parameters": {
      "embedding_model_id": "Hv_PY40Bk4MTqircAVmm",
      "inference_model_id": "SNzSY40B_1JGmyB0WbfI",
      "index": "my_test_data",
      "embedding_field": "embedding",
      "query_type": "neural",
      "source_field": [
        "text"
      ],
      "input": "${parameters.question}",
      "prompt": "\n\nHuman:You are a professional data analyst. You will always answer question based on the given context first. If the answer is not directly shown in the context, you will analyze the data and find the answer. If you don't know the answer, just say don't know. \n\n Context:\n${parameters.output_field}\n\nHuman:${parameters.question}\n\nAssistant:"
    }
  }
]
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %} 

For parameter descriptions, see [Register parameters](#register-parameters).

OpenSearch responds with an agent ID:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "9X7xWI0Bpc3sThaJdY9i"
}
```

To create a conversational agent containing a `RAGTool`, see [Conversational agents]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/index/#conversational-agents).

## Step 2: Run the agent

Before you run the agent, make sure that you add the sample OpenSearch Dashboards `Sample web logs` dataset. To learn more, see [Adding sample data]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/dashboards/quickstart#adding-sample-data).

Then, run the agent by sending the following request:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/agents/9X7xWI0Bpc3sThaJdY9i/_execute
{
  "parameters": {
    "question": "what's the population increase of Seattle from 2021 to 2023"
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %} 

OpenSearch performs vector search and returns the relevant documents:

```json
{
  "inference_results": [
    {
      "output": [
        {
          "name": "response",
          "result": """{"_index":"my_test_data","_source":{"text":"Chart and table of population level and growth rate for the Seattle metro area from 1950 to 2023. United Nations population projections are also included through the year 2035.\\n

        {"_index":"my_test_data","_source":{"text":"Chart and table of population level and growth rate for the New York City metro area from 1950 to 2023. United Nations population projections are also included through the year 2035.\\n

        """
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Register parameters

The following table lists all tool parameters that are available when registering an agent.

Parameter	| Type | Required/Optional | Description	
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
`embedding_model_id` | String | Required | The model ID of the model to use for generating vector embeddings.
`inference_model_id` | String | Required | The model ID of the LLM to use for inference.
`index` | String | Required | The index from which to retrieve relevant documents to pass to the LLM.
`embedding_field` | String | Required | When the model encodes raw text documents, the encoding result is saved in a field. Specify this field as the `embedding_field`. Neural search matches documents to the query by calculating the similarity score between the query text and the text in the document's `embedding_field`.
`source_field` | String | Required | The document field or fields to return. You can provide a list of multiple fields as an array of strings, for example, `["field1", "field2"]`.
`input` | String | Required for flow agent | Runtime input sourced from flow agent parameters. If using an LLM, this field is populated with the LLM response.
`output_field` | String | Optional | The name of the output field. Default is `response`.
`query_type` | String | Optional | Specifies the type of query to run to perform neural search. Valid values are `neural` (for dense retrieval) and `neural_sparse` (for sparse retrieval). Default is `neural`.
