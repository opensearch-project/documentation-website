# Memory and context

OpenSearch provides intelligent memory and context management systems that enable AI agents to maintain persistent knowledge and conversation context across sessions.

## Memory systems

OpenSearch offers two complementary memory approaches:

- **[Agentic memory]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/agentic-memory/)**: An intelligent memory system that uses large language models (LLMs) to extract insights, learn user preferences, and maintain contextual knowledge across agent interactions.

- **[Context management]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/context-management/)**: A structured approach to managing conversation context and system state for AI agents and applications.

## Related APIs

For programmatic access to memory and context features, see:

- **[Agentic Memory APIs]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/api/agentic-memory-apis/)**: Complete API reference for managing memory containers, sessions, and memories.
- **[Context Management APIs]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/api/context-management-apis/)**: API reference for creating and managing conversation contexts.
