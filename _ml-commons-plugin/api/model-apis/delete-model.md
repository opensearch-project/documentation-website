Deletes a model based on the `model_id`.

When you delete the last model version in a model group, that model group is automatically deleted from the index.

## Safely deleting a model
Introduced 2.19
{: .label .label-purple }

To prevent accidental deletion of models in active use by agents, search pipelines, ingest pipelines, or other components, you can enable a safety check. If the safety check is enabled and you attempt to delete a model that is in current use, OpenSearch returns an error message. To proceed with deletion:

- Identify any components using the model and either delete them or update them so that they use other models.
- Once all dependencies are cleared, delete the model.

For information about enabling this feature, see [Safely delete models]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/cluster-settings/#safely-delete-models).
