{: .label .label-purple }

Use this API to delete a specific memory by its type and ID or to delete memories matching a query. This unified API supports deleting memories of any [memory type]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/agentic-memory/#memory-types): `sessions`, `working`, `long-term`, or `history`.

## Delete a memory by type and ID

Use this API to delete a memory by type and ID.

### Endpoints

```json
DELETE /_plugins/_ml/memory_containers/<memory_container_id>/memories/<type>/<id>
```

### Path parameters

The following table lists the available path parameters.

| Parameter | Data type | Required/Optional | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `memory_container_id` | String | Required | The ID of the memory container from which to delete the memory. |
| `type` | String | Required | The type of memory to delete. Valid values are `sessions`, `working`, `long-term`, and `history`. |
| `id` | String | Required | The ID of the specific memory to delete. |

### Example request: Delete a working memory

```json
DELETE /_plugins/_ml/memory_containers/HudqiJkB1SltqOcZusVU/memories/working/XyEuiJkBeh2gPPwzjYWM
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Example request: Delete a long-term memory

```json
DELETE /_plugins/_ml/memory_containers/HudqiJkB1SltqOcZusVU/memories/long-term/DcxjTpkBvwXRq366C1Zz
```

### Example request: Delete a sessions memory

```json
DELETE /_plugins/_ml/memory_containers/HudqiJkB1SltqOcZusVU/memories/sessions/CcxjTpkBvwXRq366A1aE
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Example request: Delete a history memory

```json
DELETE /_plugins/_ml/memory_containers/HudqiJkB1SltqOcZusVU/memories/history/eMxnTpkBvwXRq366hmAU
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Example response
