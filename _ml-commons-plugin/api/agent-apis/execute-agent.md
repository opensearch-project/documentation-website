        {
          "result": """ Based on the given context, the key information is:

The metro area population of Seattle in 2021 was 3,461,000.
The metro area population of Seattle in 2023 is 3,519,000.

To calculate the population increase from 2021 to 2023:

Population in 2023 (3,519,000) - Population in 2021 (3,461,000) = 58,000

Therefore, the population increase of Seattle from 2021 to 2023 is 58,000."""
