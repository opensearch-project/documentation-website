# OpenSearch documentation

This site contains the technical documentation for [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/), the Apache 2.0-licensed search, analytics, and visualization suite with advanced security, alerting, SQL support, automated index management, deep performance analysis, and more.

[Get started](#docker-quickstart){: .btn .btn-blue }


## Getting started

- [About OpenSearch]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/)
- [Quickstart]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/quickstart/)
- [Install OpenSearch]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/install/)
- [Install OpenSearch Dashboards]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/dashboards/install/)
- [See the FAQ](https://opensearch.org/faq)

## Why use OpenSearch?

OpenSearch is well-suited to the following use cases:

* Log analytics
* Real-time application monitoring
* Clickstream analytics
* Search backend

Component | Purpose
:--- | :---
[OpenSearch]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/) | Data store and search engine
[OpenSearch Dashboards]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/dashboards/) | Search frontend and visualizations
[Security]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security-plugin/) | Authentication and access control for your cluster
[Alerting]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/monitoring-plugins/alerting/) | Receive notifications when your data meets certain conditions
[SQL]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/sql/) | Use SQL or a piped processing language to query your data
[Index State Management]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/im-plugin/) | Automate index operations
[KNN]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/knn/) | Find “nearest neighbors” in your vector data
[Performance Analyzer]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/monitoring-plugins/pa/) | Monitor and optimize your cluster
[Anomaly detection]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/monitoring-plugins/ad/) | Identify atypical data and receive automatic notifications
[ML Commons plugin]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/ml-commons-plugin/index/) | Train and execute machine-learning models
[Asynchronous search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/async/) | Run search requests in the background
[Cross-cluster replication]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/replication-plugin/index/) | Replicate your data across multiple OpenSearch clusters


Most OpenSearch plugins have corresponding OpenSearch Dashboards plugins that provide a convenient, unified user interface.

For specifics around the project, see the [FAQ](https://opensearch.org/faq/).

## The secure path forward

OpenSearch includes a demo configuration so that you can get up and running quickly, but before using OpenSearch in a production environment, you must [configure the security plugin manually]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security-plugin/configuration/index/): your own certificates, your own authentication method, your own users, and your own passwords.
