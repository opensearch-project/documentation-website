# Metrics reference

This page contains all Performance Analyzer metrics. All metrics support the `avg`, `sum`, `min`, and `max` aggregations, although certain metrics measure only one thing, making the choice of aggregation irrelevant.

For information on dimensions, see the [dimensions reference](#dimensions-reference).

This list is extensive. We recommend using Ctrl/Cmd + F to find what you're looking for.

Operation | Type of operation (e.g. `shardbulk`).
ShardRole | `primary`, `replica`
Exception | OpenSearch exceptions (e.g. `org.opensearch.index_not_found_exception`).
Indices | The list of indices in the request URI.
HTTPRespCode | Response code from OpenSearch (e.g. `200`).
MemType | `totYoungGC`, `totFullGC`, `Survivor`, `PermGen`, `OldGen`, `Eden`, `NonHeap`, `Heap`
DiskName | Name of the disk (e.g. `sda1`).
DestAddr | Destination address (e.g. `010015AC`).
Direction | `in`, `out`
ThreadPoolType | The OpenSearch thread pools (e.g. `index`, `search`,`snapshot`).
