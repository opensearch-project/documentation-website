# Monitoring your cluster

OpenSearch provides several ways for you to monitor your cluster health and performance and automate common tasks:

- The OpenSearch [logs]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/monitoring-your-cluster/logs/) include valuable information for monitoring cluster operations and troubleshooting issues. 

- [Performance analyzer]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/monitoring-your-cluster/pa/index/) is an agent and REST API that allows you to query numerous performance metrics for your cluster, including aggregations of those metrics. 

- OpenSearch [Job Scheduler]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/monitoring-your-cluster/job-scheduler/index/) plugin provides a framework that you can use to build schedules for common cluster management tasks.
