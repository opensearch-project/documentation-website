# Parent aggregations

The `parent` aggregation is a bucket aggregation that creates a single bucket containing parent documents, based on parent-child relationships defined in your index. This aggregation enables you to perform analytics on parent documents that have the same matching child documents, allowing for powerful hierarchical data analysis.

The `parent` aggregation works with the [`join` field type]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/field-types/supported-field-types/join/), which establishes parent-child relationships within documents in the same index.

The `parent` aggregation identifies parent documents that have matching child documents, whereas the [`children` aggregation]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/aggregations/bucket/children/) identifies child documents that match a certain child relation. Both aggregations take the child relation name as input.


## Parameters

The `parent` aggregation takes the following parameters:

| Parameter             | Required/Optional | Data type       | Description |
| :--                   | :--               |  :--            | :--         |
| `type`                | Required          | String          | The name of the child type from the `join` field. |

## Example

The following example builds a small company database with three employees. The employee records each have a child `join` relationship with a parent department record.

First, create a `company` index with a `join` field that maps departments (parents) to employees (children):

```json
PUT /company
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "join_field": {
        "type": "join",
        "relations": {
          "department": "employee"
        }
      },
      "department_name": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "employee_name": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "salary": {
        "type": "double"
      },
      "hire_date": {
        "type": "date"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Next, populate the data with three departments and three employees. The parent-child assignments are presented in the following table.

| Department (parent) | Employees (children) |
| :-- | :-- |
| `Accounting` | `Abel Anderson`, `Betty Billings` |
| `Engineering` | `Carl Carter` |
| `HR` | none |

The `routing` parameter ensures that both parent and child documents are stored on the same shard, which is required in order for parent-child relationships to function correctly in OpenSearch:

```json
POST _bulk?routing=1
{ "create": { "_index": "company", "_id": "1" } }
{ "type": "department", "department_name": "Accounting", "join_field": "department" }
{ "create": { "_index": "company", "_id": "2" } }
{ "type": "department", "department_name": "Engineering", "join_field": "department" }
{ "create": { "_index": "company", "_id": "3" } }
{ "type": "department", "department_name": "HR", "join_field": "department" }
{ "create": { "_index": "company", "_id": "4" } }
{ "type": "employee", "employee_name": "Abel Anderson", "salary": 120000, "hire_date": "2024-04-04", "join_field": { "name": "employee",  "parent": "1" } }
{ "create": { "_index": "company", "_id": "5" } }
{ "type": "employee", "employee_name": "Betty Billings", "salary": 140000, "hire_date": "2023-05-05", "join_field": { "name": "employee",  "parent": "1" } }
{ "create": { "_index": "company", "_id": "6" } }
{ "type": "employee", "employee_name": "Carl Carter", "salary": 140000, "hire_date": "2020-06-06",  "join_field": { "name": "employee",  "parent": "2" } }
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

Lastly, run an aggregation of all the departments that have a parent relationship with one or more employees:

```json
GET /company/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "all_departments": {
      "parent": {
        "type": "employee"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "departments": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "department_name"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

The `all_departments` parent aggregation returns all the departments with employee child documents. Note that the HR department is not represented:

```json
{
  "took": 3,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 6,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": null,
    "hits": []
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "all_departments": {
      "doc_count": 2,
      "departments": {
        "doc_count_error_upper_bound": 0,
        "sum_other_doc_count": 0,
        "buckets": [
          {
            "key": "Accounting",
            "doc_count": 1
          },
          {
            "key": "Engineering",
            "doc_count": 1
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
