# Children

The `children` aggregation connects parent documents with their related child documents. This allows you to analyze relationships between different types of data in a single query, rather than needing to run multiple queries and combine the results manually.

---

## Example index, sample data, and children aggregation query

For example, if you have a parent-child relationship between authors, posts, and comments, you can analyze the relationships between the different data types (`authors`, `posts`, and `comments`) in a single query. 

The `authors` aggregation groups the documents by the `author.keyword` field. This allows you to see the number of documents associates with each author. 

In each author group, the `children` aggregation retrieves the associated posts. This gives you a breakdown of the posts written by each author. 

In the `posts` aggregation, another `children` aggregation fetches the comments associated with each post. This provides you a way to see the comments for each individual post. 

In the `comments` aggregation, the `value_count` aggregation counts the number of comments on each post. This allows you to gauge the engagement level for each post by seeing the number of comments it has received.
