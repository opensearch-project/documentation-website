## What's new

New in version 2.9, OpenSearch introduces _extensions_---an easier-to-develop and more secure alternative to plugins---to simplify creating custom functionality for OpenSearch. To learn more about building extensions using _OpenSearch SDK for Java_, see [Extensions]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/developer-documentation/extensions/).
